I have received this tutorial request many times lately so I hope you enjoy it. The cheat sheet can be found below the video.<br /><br />I cover quotes, comments, date(), variables, data types, getting data from HTML, heredoc, constants, arithmetic, shortcuts, reference operators, comparison operators, if, elseif, else, echo, printf, ternary operator, switch, while, for, foreach, arrays, strings, and much more.</p></div>

<div><div><div>This is a great video, but I think some new comers might find it a bit over their head. Don't expect to learn PHP in 30 minutes. Expect to understand how/why PHP is used. Expect to understand some basics to PHP, which give you some context to use PHP in the future. 

I would recommend watching this video over and over, paying attention to what you know and what you dont know. If you don't know something, go Google it, watch another video about that specific topic, and come back to this video. Watch it again. Figure out what you understand and what you don't. Explore what you don't understand, then come back and watch the video again. Rinse and repeat. 

You need to understand ALL the terms used in the video, understand HOW they all relate, and understand WHY knowing the information is important. If you can't answer these questions, you don't fully understand the concept you're looking at.  

I'm new to the whole programming/IT/CS thing, but I've always been fluent at computers. It seems to me context is more more important than knowing specifics. You need to learn HOW things are used/WHAT they are used for BEFORE you can start using it personally. I could be wrong, but until someone tells me so, this is how I'm approaching it. I have to say, I've gained a lot of knowledge in the past couple weeks using this method.

If you want to learn as much as possible, watch videos from Derek Banas, Eli the Computer Guy, and CodersCult. These three Channels seem to work together at explaining things, though they were made separate of each other.﻿</div></div>

<div><div><div>Nice video. I like these quick language summary videos. I wouldn't recommend this if someone were learning PHP as their first language but for people who are comfortable with other languages or already know PHP and need a refresher these are great.

I'd like to see a C or C++ video, that's my vote. Keep up the good work and thanks for the videos.﻿</div></div>

<div><div><div>this is perfect  for people who already understand how to code. I have experience in Java and C++, so apart from the syntax the logic is pretty much the same. Thank you Derek﻿</div></div>
