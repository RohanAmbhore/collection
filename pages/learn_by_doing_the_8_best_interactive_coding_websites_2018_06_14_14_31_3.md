While <em>most</em> online resources do have some interactive tests or challenges you can take that allows you to actually code, some focus <em>heavily</em> on having you <strong>practice</strong> which I believe is the best way to get better at coding.</p><blockquote id="b0fb">Watching videos and reading tutorials online will only get you so far. To become a great programmer, you’ll need a ton of practice. So for beginners, I recommend solving lots of code challenges and working on several small projects.</blockquote><p id="f774">This list is a combination of my own research and some help from people in online coding communities such as <a href="https://coderbyte.com/member" target="_blank">Coderbyte</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/" target="_blank">r/learnprogramming</a>, <a href="http://newbiecoderwarehouse.com/" target="_blank">Newbie Coder Warehouse</a>, and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-200-javascript-articles-on-medium-until-jan-2017-a0c6a1bfe094" target="_blank">Medium</a>.</p><h3 id="e371">Complete Beginner to Novice Level</h3><p id="5690">At this point, you’re completely new to coding or have been learning to code for a few weeks. Try and learn the basics of HTML and CSS, but don’t go crazy trying to memorize all the tags and properties for them. Learn some JavaScript and practice coding so you can pick up the syntax at this stage. You should be comfortable solving a few <a href="https://coderbyte.com/course/learn-javascript-in-one-week" target="_blank">basic coding challenges</a> and you should know the syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or Python, Ruby, etc.) fairly well.</p><ol><li id="9c97"><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Code School</strong></a><br />Great for beginners.

You need to become comfortable with writing basic algorithms that involve hash tables, arrays, looping, string manipulation, etc. If you’re interested in web development, then you should also be able to create simple UI’s and websites fairly quickly with some basic HTML and CSS.</p><ol><li id="dbe4"><a href="https://coderbyte.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Coderbyte</strong></a><br />Practice solving code challenges here and implementing different algorithms and data structures.
