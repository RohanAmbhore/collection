                        <p>React's ability to efficiently render declarative user interfaces can seem almost magical. Most developers probably have a rough idea of how it identifies changes and applies them using a "virtual DOM". But how many truly understand the details of what is happening behind the scenes? Fascinated by this question, I…</p>

                        <p>Redux has emerged as the preeminent framework for building React-based web applications. It perfectly complements React's declarative views with a straightforward and elegant architecture that brings some of the best ideas of software engineering theory (immutable global state, functional programming, Event Sourcing, CQRS, etc.) into the web development mainstream. "There…</p>

                        <p>Redux is one of the most discussed JavaScript front-end technologies. It has defined few paradigms that vastly improve developer efficiency and give us a solid foundation for building apps in a simple yet robust way. No framework is perfect though, and even Redux has its drawbacks. Redux has the special…</p>

                        <p>It was around 2011 and I was working for a small company with the ambitious goal of building the world's sexiest cloud CRM product. To build a great product, you need great technologies. Fortunately, one of my colleagues was a tech maven who tried hard to stay on top of…</p>

                        <p>ESLint was launched in June 2013 and has rapidly become the most popular JavaScript linter. It offers a number of advantages over other linters including fine-grained, configurable rules and plugin support. This flexibility can also be a weakness, however, as you can easily get lost in the multitude of options.…</p>
