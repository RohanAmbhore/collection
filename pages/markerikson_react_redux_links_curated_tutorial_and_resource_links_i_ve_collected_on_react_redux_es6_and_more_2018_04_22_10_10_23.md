<p>Curated tutorial and resource links I've collected on React, Redux, ES6, and more, meant to be a collection of high-quality articles and resources for someone who wants to learn about the React-Redux ecosystem, as well as a source for quality information on advanced topics and techniques.  Not quite "awesome", but hopefully useful as a starting point I can give to others.  Suggestions welcome.</p>
<p>Another important resource is the <strong>Reactiflux community on Discord</strong>, which has chat channels dedicated to discussion of React, Redux, and other related technologies.  There's always a number of people hanging out and answering questions, and it's a great place to ask questions and learn.  The invite link is at <strong><a href="https://www.reactiflux.com" target="_blank">https://www.reactiflux.com</a></strong>.</p>
<p>You might also want to check out my categorized list of Redux-related addons, libraries, and utilities, at <a href="https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links" target="_blank">Redux Ecosystem Links</a>.  Also see <a href="/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/community-resources.md" target="_blank">Community Resources</a> for links to other links lists, podcasts, and email newsletters.  Finally, I also keep a dev blog at <a href="http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com" target="_blank">blog.isquaredsoftware.com</a>, where I write about React, Redux, Webpack, and more.</p>
