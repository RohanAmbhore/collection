		<p>A good UI is an important part of the development experience. The MongoDB Shell works great for administrative actions, but when working with larger amounts of data, the UI becomes fairly important.</p>
<p>In 2014, we discussed 4 of the top MongoDB GUIs: MongoVue, MongoHub, RockMongo, and Robomongo. We left those at the end of this post for your review. Since then, however, many new options have emerged and we thought we’d share our updates.</p>
<h2><b>Comparing MongoDB GUIs</b></h2>
<p>In this article, we are going to compare 4 of the top MongoDB User Interfaces that help developers increase their productivity and manage their database. We’ll be focusing on data visualization, presentation, and editing. As always, your mileage will vary depending on your scenario and preferences. Read on to find out which is the best MongoDB GUI for you, updated for 2016.</p>
<h3>1.  MongoDB Compass</h3>

<p>It provides users with a graphical view of their MongoDB schema without requiring the use of query language. In MongoDB, collections do not enforce a rigidly-defined document structure. This can make it difficult to explore and understand the underlying data and its structure without a tool like MongoDB Compass.</p>
<p>MongoDB Compass analyses your documents and displays rich structures within your collections in a simple and intuitive GUI. It allows you to quickly visualize and explore your schema to understand the frequency, types, and ranges of fields in your dataset.</p>

<p>Here are some features provided by MongoDB Compass:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visually explore your data</li>
<li>Run ad hoc queries in seconds</li>
<li>View your query performance</li>
<li>Compass empowers you to make smarter decisions about indexing, document validation, and more</li>
<li>No command line needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: While the UI looks slick, it is neither a full-featured development UI or a full-featured BI tool to mine your data. Will be interesting to see in which direction it will proceed.</p>
<p>Platforms: Mac OS X, Windows</p>
<p>Pricing: Free for development purposes; contact MongoDB for Commercial/Advanced Licenses</p>
<h3>2.  Robomongo</h3>

		
		<a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=%23Robomongo+is+a+pioneer+of+ideas+and+techniques+implemented+for+the+1st+time+in+%23MongoDB+ecosystem.&url=https://scalegrid.io/blog/which-is-the-best-mongodb-gui/&via=dharshanrg" target="_blank">Robomongo is a pioneer of some interesting GUI ideas and techniques that were implemented for the first time in MongoDB ecosystem.Click To Tweet</a>

<h2>The Best Mongo GUI’s of 2014 – Recommendations from 2014-</h2>
<h3>1.  <a href="http://www.mongovue.com/" target="_blank">MongoVue</a> </h3>
<p>MongoVue is a desktop GUI for the windows platform. It has a simple clean UI and the basic features are free. Data can be presented in text view, tree view or table view. You can also save your find queries for later usage – we find this rather convenient. The more advanced features require you to purchase a license. Overall the software appears stable and well maintained.</p>
<p><a href="https://scalegrid.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mongovue.png" target="_blank" class="readableLinkWithLargeImage"><div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img src="https://scalegrid.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mongovue-300x246.png"   alt="MongoDB GUI - MongoVUE" /></div></a></p>
<h3>2.  <a href="http://mongohub.todayclose.com/" target="_blank">MongoHub</a></h3>
<p>is a native Mac GUI for MongoDB. It provides you an option to connect to your MongoDB server through an SSH tunnel which is fairly convenient from a security perspective. The “StatMonitor” feature gives you a live display of stats a.k.a mongostat. The query interface is a little bit more limited in that it only seems to support a tree view. Also, there is no way to save a find query for later. In our experience, the software appears to work fairly well but it doesn’t seem like it is being maintained – so use at your own risk.</p>
<p><a href="https://scalegrid.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mongohub.png" target="_blank" class="readableLinkWithLargeImage"><div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img src="https://scalegrid.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mongohub-300x225.png"   alt="MongoHub: MongoDB GUI" /></div></a></p>
<h3>3. <a href="http://rockmongo.com/" target="_blank">RockMongo</a></h3>
<p>An HTML-based MongoDB GUI. The GUI is authored in PHP and is open source. The downside of the HTML based approach is that you need a PHP server to run this GUI. You can also choose to run the PHP server on your local box. The UI is no frill, fairly easy to use and supports all the common options of working with collections, stats etc. The find interface only presents data in a tabular/text model – so it could be an issue when you are working with multilevel documents. Also, there doesn’t seem to be a lot of check-in activity – so we suspect the project is inactive.</p>
<p><a href="https://scalegrid.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rockmongo.png" target="_blank" class="readableLinkWithMediumImage"><img src="https://scalegrid.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/rockmongo-300x163.png" width="300" height="163" alt="Rockmongo:MongoDB GUI" /></a></p>
<h3>4.  <a href="http://robomongo.org/" target="_blank">RoboMongo</a></h3>
<p>A shell-centric MongoDB GUI that supports the Windows, iOS, and Linux platforms. It’s still early days for RoboMongo with the latest version being 0.8.4. It is also one of the few GUI’s that supports SSL connections to your MongoDB server. There is also support for connecting through an SSH tunnel. The query interface displays data in tree view, table view and text view.</p>
<p>You can also save your queries for later usage. One of the coolest features is that it also has support for the shell – so you can still continue to use the shell commands that you are comfortable with. There are some quirks in the UI which I think will get worked out over time. If actively maintained I think this could be the best cross-platform GUI for MongoDB.</p>
