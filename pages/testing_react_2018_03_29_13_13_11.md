This will allow me to develop more content, so it's a win-win really.</p>
<p>You can access the full chapter by buying a copy through <a href="https://leanpub.com/survivejs-react" target="_blank">Leanpub</a>. It goes into detail, whereas the following should give you a rough idea of the chapter contents.</p>
<h2>TL;DR<a href="#tl-dr" target="_blank">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Basic testing techniques include unit testing, acceptance testing, property based testing, and mutation testing.</li>
<li>Unit testing allows us to ascertain <em>specific</em> certain truths.</li>
<li>Acceptance testing allows us to test qualitative aspects of our system.</li>
<li>Property based testing (see <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck" target="_blank">QuickCheck</a>) is more generic and allows us to cover a wider range of values more easily. These tests are more difficult to write, though.</li>
<li>Mutation testing makes it possible to test the tests. Unfortunately, it's not a particularly popular technique with JavaScript yet.</li>
<li>Cesar Andreu's <a href="https://github.com/cesarandreu/web-app" target="_blank">web-app</a> has a nice testing setup (Mocha/Karma/Istanbul).</li>
<li>Code coverage helps us to understand what parts of the code remain untested. It does not, however, give us any guarantees of the quality of our tests.</li>
<li><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html" target="_blank">React Test Utilities</a> give us a nice way to write unit tests for components. There are lighter APIs, such as <a href="https://github.com/jquense/react-testutil-query" target="_blank">jquense/react-testutil-query</a>.</li>
<li>Alt provides a good means for testing <a href="http://alt.js.org/docs/testing/actions/" target="_blank">actions</a> and <a href="http://alt.js.org/docs/testing/stores/" target="_blank">stores</a>.</li>
<li>Testing provides you confidence. This will become particularly important as your codebase grows. It will become harder to break things inadvertently.</li>
</ul>
