<div><div><div>Great video! 
I am not familiar with Express, so I have this question: How come the app.get('*',...) did not also catch the requests for css and bundle.js? Were those files maybe accidentally in the browser cache, or is there some subtlety that I missed?
Anyone?﻿</div>

<div><div><div>so you said create a grab all GET route for the node express server.  But what if i have express end points for my CRUD app like GET/users Post, Put and delete.  I could just make the grab all GET route after these end points?
