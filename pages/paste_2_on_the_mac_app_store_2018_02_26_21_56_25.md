    <div id="ember962">The main thing I wanted to achieve with a clipboard app was the ability to open it with a shortcut, and then immediately paste with another shortcut. It wasn’t totally clear in the description if I was able to do that, but I figured there was a good chance it would, and at least the other features would be useful.<br /><br />Turns out it does do that, and those commands are customizable. I’m so pumped. And it’s even more useful than I expected. As a designer I have my color palettes right at my fingertips all the time… it saves hex color codes as colored cards which is crazy useful and was a totally pleasant surprise. The UI is awesome and smooth and the more I use it the more the more I like it. <br /><br />My only pieces of feedback would be to have numbers on the snippets so I don’t have to count when pasting, perhaps only when you have the direct pasting option selected. Also would be great to have the option to keep the interface on screen so I’d be able to keep copying and pasting without having to open it each time. And would be nice to have ability to change sizes of snippets or have some sort of text-only option so I could see more clippings at once. Great app guys, thanks…</div>

    <div id="ember985">I’ve been using Paste for over 6 months now, and I can’t imagine not having it now. As a designer, I’m constantly copying, pasting, and moving things in Sketch and Illustrator and with Paste it is so easy to just go back and grab anything I’ve ever copied. I no longer worry about whether I should copy something because it will overwrite something I will also need. With Paste, everything is made so easily. Not only that, it has a gorgeous UI, showing items in my Clipboard beautifully and easy to find. It still blows me away sometimes. And the search feature works absolutely wonderfully. It is so great, I wish Apple would integrate it into macOS and iOS as I really would love this feature on my iPhone and iPad Pro.<br /><br />If you use your computer for productivity, Paste is an absolute necessity and a joy to use. You won’t regret purchasing it…</div>

    <div id="ember1008">I’ve tried many clipboard managers before and nothing stuck for me. Unlike those apps, Paste has really become a part of my workflow. It really dawned on me a few days after I first started using Paste how much I enjoyed it. I thought I had lost a snippet while copying and pasting a bunch of items around, and was annoyed at myself. But then it occured to me that, of course, I didn’t lose anything, I had Paste to save me. There my snippet was in my Paste history. Thanks Paste! Paste can do so much more, but the basics are intutive and invaluable…</div>
