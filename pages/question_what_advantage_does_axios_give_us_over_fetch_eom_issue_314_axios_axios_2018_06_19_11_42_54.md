          <p>Overall they are very similar. Some benefits of axios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transformers: allow performing transforms on data before request is made or after response is received</li>
<li>Interceptors: allow you to alter the request or response entirely (headers as well). also perform async operations before request is made or before Promise settles</li>
<li>Built-in XSRF protection</li>

<p><em>fetch</em> has yet to provide a standard way of aborting a request. Therefore, there's no way to implement connection timeout. (<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/27" target="_blank">#27</a>, <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/447" target="_blank">#447</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>fetch</em> has failed to provide an API to set response <code>timeout</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/20" target="_blank">#20</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>...which means that you'll have to wait until the end of the response or the occurrence of a network error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...or, use <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>Promise.race</code> to manually reject the returned promise if you need a timeout. And it has a tiny side effect (<a href="https://github.com/github/fetch/issues/175" target="_blank">#175</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>mislav</strong> commented on 29 Jul 2015</em><br />
Also note that with the above implementation, even if the timeout happens, the original request won't be aborted because we don't have an API to abort fetch requests. Instead, <strong>the request will complete in the background but its response will get discarded</strong>.</p>

<p>See the <strong>comments</strong> of <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/03/this-api-is-so-fetching/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>. And I'm totally agree with the following one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>J W</strong></em><br />
Although the standard loosely talks about timeout’s, they never explain as to how you would specify one either. Unfortunately, <strong>a complete deal breaker</strong> for any use cases that I would use it for.<br />

<p>Perhaps the information in this thread could be added to the readme? I think there are plenty of people who choose fetch over xhr just because it's the shiny new thing, and then have to refactor a bunch of code as they realise fetch doesn't support as many use cases as xhr does.</p>

          <p><a href="https://github.com/larsnystrom" target="_blank">@larsnystrom</a> I also just now discovered axios because of <code>apisauce</code> using it. I wondered why it didn't use <code>fetch</code>. I am using <code>fetch</code> because its the default for any <code>reactjs</code> sample out there.<br />
But after reading this comparison here I'll ditch <code>fetch</code> because I want timeouts and always wondered why <code>fetch</code> does not have it. And if you see the referenced issues over there, they are so old I doubt they will ever end up in <code>fetch</code>.</p>
<p>So I think a comparison of two libraries on the front pages' readme would help people to choose one over the other.</p>

<p>With fetch you can add event listeners for Service Worker to intercept. Haven't found a way to do that with XHR yet.</p>
<p>Can fetch support be added axios as an Adapter?</p>

Many people have sites on cheap hosts with LAMP-stacks. Even when you have full control of your web host, the fact that you have to change your server-side code to deal with file uploads just because you decided to use fetch over XHR in the client should give paus for thought.</p>
