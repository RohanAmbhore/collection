<p>I don't think this is possible but I've not been able to find anything conclusive.</p>

<p>Ideally I would like to register my Action Extension to be launched by a specific scheme - instead of my main application. I want this because of the benefit of being able to return to the previous application after completion.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
