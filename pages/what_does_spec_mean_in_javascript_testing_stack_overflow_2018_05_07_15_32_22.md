<p>I'm fairly new to the Javascript world (coming from Android) so I've been reading up on how to setup Mocha/Jasmine to get my test environment in place.  I've noticed a convention of "spec" in reference to test directories, file suffix, suite names, and/or tests/assertions.  </p>

<p>Is this specific to testing in Javascript?  And what does "spec" actually stand for?  Specification, Expectation, or ?</p>
