Not true. As the documentations states and as you can see in the source of equals, the hashes are not collision free.<br />
They are only used to detect a difference. If the hashes are the same, an expensive deep comparison is done nevertheless.<br />
Unfortunatly, ImmutableJS doesn't say how low the collision rate for their hashes are, so one could decide if one could trust the hashes for non-critical applications.<br />
If someone knows that rate or another hashing solution for ImmutableJS or just wants to disagree, I'd happy to hear about it :)</p></div></article><article id="comment_14783103"><div><div><div><a href="/user52816926" target="_blank">Max Stoiber</a><time>1 year ago</time><div><p><a href="/markus" target="_blank">@Markus</a>: Oh wow, that's really good to know, my bad! Thanks for letting me know!</p>
<p>It's probably still better than doing a deep comparison every time though, so the recommendation stands. üëç</p></div></article><article id="comment_14817813"><div><div><div><a href="/user54983066" target="_blank">Bertram Truong</a><time>1 year ago</time><div><p>No way!

<p>I would really like to know the answer to "When should one use react-boilerplate and when should one not?". I'm currently starting a new project and I have started using react-boilerplate as my base. I actually spent last week trying to build my own skeleton, but shortly after realising how much effort it takes, I came across react-boilerplate as it contains mostly everything I need. Is it ready for production use?</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the talk, <a href="/max" target="_blank">@Max</a>! Great presentation and incredibly informative.</p></div><div><div><article id="comment_14835674"><div><div><div><a href="/user52816926" target="_blank">Max Stoiber</a><time>1 year ago</time><div><p>Yes, it is ready for production use, that's exactly what it's made for! Hope your project goes well üòä</p></div></article></article><article id="comment_15149599"><div><div><div><a href="/user59200331" target="_blank">Akhil AK</a><time>1 year ago</time><div><p>Hey <a href="/max" target="_blank">@max</a> great demo. I have a question on the react-boilerplate that will it allow me to do server side rendering. What do you think about server side rendering will increase the SEO.</p></div></article><article id="comment_15444598"><div><div><div><a href="/user58423847" target="_blank">Takahiro Saeki</a><time>1 year ago</time><div><p><a href="/max" target="_blank">@max</a> thanks awesome speech and description. I'm not familiar with using Redux-saga. It's including new feature of ECMAScript. So, I was influence by your speech. really thanks!</p></div></article><div><div><div><label><img src="https://i1.wp.com/devi.vimeocdn.com/portrait/default-blue_40x40.png?ssl=1" /></label></div><div><div><label>Add a new comment</label></div></section>
