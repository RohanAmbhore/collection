<ul>
<li>Electron version: <code>^1.6.2</code></li>
<li>Operating system: OSX, Windows</li>
</ul>
<h3>Expected behavior</h3>
<p>CPU-intensive tasks running in the electron main thread should not have impact on BrowserWindow performance.</p>
<h3>Actual behavior</h3>
<p>CPU-intensive tasks running in the electron main thread have a significant impact on performance of BrowserWindow.</p>
<h3>How to reproduce</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't have a very simple set up of reproducing this. But I can show you what it looks like in this gif. I delayed the load of the cpu intensive task for ~800ms after window load which is why the spinner runs smoothly at first and then starts lagging.</p>

<p>The spinner itself is built using css animations, no javascript. I also tried SVG-based animations which had even worse lags.</p>
<p>Any ideas how to resolve this?</p>
