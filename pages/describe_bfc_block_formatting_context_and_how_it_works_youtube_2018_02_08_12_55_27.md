<div><div><div>thank you so much for this video, as crazy as it might sound, this is probably the only clear video about BFC in the entire world. It became somewhat of my hobby since probably 2005 to check if finally somebody uploaded a good video about BFC on the youtube and you finally did it.﻿</div>

<div><div><div>It is my first day studying css and I was already exposed to an example where BFC was used to work around the height problem in a parent with floating children. I feel lucky that I've come across this video about a concept that apparently takes some time to wrap your head around and even some relatively experienced developers don't seem to know about. Thank you and congrats. Subscribed﻿</div>
