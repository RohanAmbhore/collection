      <tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hey,<p>Since years I've been seeing tones of news "how machine learing did smth...

I would like to understand the topic really seriously and be able to explore this area...

I've got enthusiasm, some ideas for a projects, but still don't know almost anything about how exactly everything works.</p><p>When I was starting with programming, I read some books, watched online lecture and bang. I started doing my own projects. How to start in this more scientifically sophisticated area?</p><p>Are there any courses, books, online lectures which you can recommend me for a start to understand how it all works? Unfortunately, my university doesn't lead any more interesting courses in this area...

                  I'm probably the worst example of how to get into this field of work, but since I do <i>actually</i> work on developing and applying ML algorithms every day, I think my case might be relevant.<p>Firstly, my background is not in mathematics or computer science what-so-ever; I'm a classically trained botanist who started came at the issue of programming, computer science, and ML from a perspective of "I've got questions I want to ask and techniques I want to apply that I'm currently under prepared to answer."</p><p>Working as a technician for the USDA, I learned programming (R and python) primarily because I needed a better way to deal with large data sets than excel (which prior to 5 years ago was all I used). At some point I put my foot down and decided I would go no further until I learned to manage the data I was collecting programmatically. The data I was collecting were UAV imagery, field and spectral reference data, specifically regarding the distribution of invasive plant species in cropping systems. The central thrust of the project was to automatically detect and delineate weed-species in cropping systems from low altitude UAV collects. This eventually folded into doing a masters degree continuing to develop this project. That folded into additional projects applying ML methods to feature discrimination in a wide range of data types. Currently I work for a geo-spatial company, doing vegetative classification in a wide range of environments with some incredibly interesting data (sometimes).</p><p>I think you've got the issue a bit cart-horse backwards. In a sense I see you as having a solution, but no problem to apply it too. The methods are <i>ALL</i> there, and there are plenty of other posts in this thread addressing where to learn the principals of ML. What this doesn't offer you, is a why of why you should care about a thing? My recommendation would be to find something of personal interest to you in which ML <i>may</i> play a role.</p><p>With out a good reason to apply the techniques that everyone else here is outlining, I think it would be too challenging to keep the level of interest and energy required to realize how to apply these concepts. Watching lectures, reading articles, doing coursework is all very important, but it shouldn't be thought of as a replacement for having personally meaningful work to do. Meaningful work will do more to drive your interests than anything.

                  This reads as an amazing journey.  Kudos for your pursuit of a better process.<p>It seems to me that so many (online) courses jump to applying tf/pytorch to a predefined dataset, whereas most of the work is in preparing the data. I have a personal project I'd like to try out classifying images, and haven't had much luck finding resources on building my own training dataset.</p><p>Can you recommend any resources on assembling and collating your own dataset?

                  It should be noted that I deal primarily with geo-spatial image analysis, so there is a not insignificant amount of bias with regards to what data I'm interested in. I like using the USDA NAIP API for imagery, since I can call in imagery using GDAL directly into python or R. I rely heavily on freely available public utility data sets (Parcel level utility data). Beyond that and other than as a starting point, you're training data is always going to be something you've invested in heavily. Good training data is 100% the game. No modeling exercise is going to go well on poor quality training data. Currently as a personal project, I'm trying to develop a platform for developing and training data for geospatial modeling. If you're interested, hit me up on a PM and I can explain it in more detail (after work).

                  I'll second that. Without solving a real problem it's hard to learn something. You can learn the basics but then it's about applying them to a real problem and find out what works and what doesn't. It's the same with a lot of CS  graduates. They know a lot of fancy algorithms but they have no idea when to use them and when not.

                  I'm surprised that no one has yet mentioned Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera and to go a bit deeper, his deep learning specialization on Coursera as well. Along with the programming assignments it's a solid way to get your feet wet. And definitely second the suggestion of the fast.ai courses as well

                  As somebody that has started learning AI/ML and was looking at the exact question here three months ago - I found the Andrew Ng <i>deeplearning.ai Coursera course</i> an amazing starting point.<p>It was high level enough, and got me to understand enough, to get me to a point where I could start trying to build a side-project, without exposing me to the deeper math behind Neural Nets.</p><p>It was a great starting point without being overwhelming. Now I feel that I have the option to either go deeper if I need to, or go wider.</p><p>I find Andrew Ng to be an amazing teacher - explains things simply, clearly, and in a way that I find super easy to understand.

                  This is true, but it's more than that: the fastai professors (Jeremy + Rachel) have studied how people learn.  How teachers can structure courses to maximize understanding.<p>They believe (and have research backing them up), that the way we teach math (base and rote concepts, building until you can understand something complex) is sub-optimal.  They dive into the code and get stuff done, then later bubble back up for concepts.</p><p>For me, it was bewildering at first, but if you can trust your instructor, you trust they won't leave you stranded.  (It does also require the type of student who does a lot of study on their own!)

                  I took this course in the Fall of 2011, before Coursera existed, when it was introduced to the public as "ML Class" (sponsored by Stanford).<p>I agree - it's a great introduction, and I learned a ton from it (and it answered a ton of questions I had until then).

                  I took this course. Andrew is a great teacher. However, I wish he worked on his public speaking a bit. He has certain speech patterns, like starting sentences with "it turns out..." and after a while it becomes extremely irritating, at least to me.<p>Fantastic course though.

                  IMO, to start with AI, it's best to start as simple as possible so that you understand the algorithms that drive things that are accessible to tweak. If you are a gamer, think about the various AI routines that control pathfinding, resource collection, and strategy for computer players in strategy games. Some of the concepts of BFS and DFS build into Minimax strategies and other types of "simple" approaches to searching decision spaces/states for optimal approaches to problem solving. This gets into the development of heuristics for approximating outcomes. All of this is fantastic baseline for understanding more complex AI and machine learning algorithms. While it's easy to jump into ML or AI at a higher level, without the baseline understanding of the search algorithms and probability landscapes that are underpinnings to advanced work in these fields, you'll probably never feel like you understand what is going on.<p>You can find some fun tutorials here: <a href="https://www.redblobgames.com" target="_blank">https://www.redblobgames.com</a></p><p>The CS 188 "Intro to AI" class at Berkeley is excellent: <a href="http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html" target="_blank">http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html</a></p><p>It used to be on edx.org but I think a lawsuit about accessibility required them to remove it?

Lots of businesses have specific problems, and will pay me to solve them.</p><p>The Fast.AI course (part 1 v2) is the best way to get started, IMO.  The fastai library wraps up a lot of boilerplate, and gives you a simple recipe w/ conceptual understandings to achieve state of the art results (top 20% on just about any kaggle competition) in just a couple months of intensive study.

                  Fast.AI is 100% focused on getting into DOING stuff. Its guiding philosophy is that teaching the math first instead of teaching you how to actually do some machine learning is backwards. The lectures start with a dozen lines of code that learns how to discriminate between cats and dogs and then follows up on that by slowly removing layers of abstraction. It's very cool.<p>That said, the lectures are pretty rough around the edges compared to something like a coursera class. And his goal is to get you to play around with stuff on your own using his stuff as a jumping off point. It works well for some people but not as much for others.

                  I started with Andrew Ng's ML courses, which take a bottom-up approach beginning with the math. After finishing the deeplearning.ai track, I started rounding out my skillset with some data science and R programming classes, so I could be more comfortable working with unfamiliar data.<p>The fast.ai courses are a more top-down approach to ML, and there are plenty of good reasons for taking this approach. You'll start getting practice with libraries like Tensorflow right away. However, if you have a fairly strong math background and linear algebra doesn't give you nightmares, I highly recommend the Andrew Ng courses. A deep (ha!) understanding what's going on "under the hood" in ML will help your debugging, inform your strategy, and make your code better in the long run.

                  I'm very adamant that if you really want to be an AI researcher, it starts with the mathematics. Multi-variable calculus, linear algebra,discrete math, probability and statistics are key. The classic books and courses others have suggested are excellent starting points.<p>I'll also say something here that isn't established, so I may take some heat. I believe there are two main paths in AI that will eventually converge to general AI: symbolic and sub-symbolic reasoning. If you go the path of symbolic reasoning, studying functional programming, theory of computation,type theory, natural language processing/compilers are in your future. If you go the path of sub-symbolic reasoning, you will be closer to optimization methods, neural networks, etc. It really depends on what you want to do. Ex: Computer vision is all about sub-symbolic reasoning, while natural language processing is heavily about symbolic reasoning. Of course advanced applications mix both! If you want to go after general AI, you gotta figure out how to tackle both forms of reasoning.</p><p>In the end, if you are serious about being an AI researcher, you will have to be a great computer scientist and mathematician. This is why it seems so difficult to get into. "Do I focus on working on messing with libraries and algorithms or the mathematical theory? And if I do both, how!?"</p><p>It's not easy, but just start and keep going. Others have provided great advice. One of my greatest joys in life has been coming to understand the marriage of computer science and mathematics under the banner of AI. It is really something exciting worth living for.</p><p>[Never give up!](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE</a>)</p><p>Also, I recently gave a talk on getting into AI and my view on the state of things.

                  I would recommend working on as many Kaggle competitions as you can. Try your best to understand manipulating data quickly and efficiently (use Python). Using the correct algorithm is typically trivial and a solved problem for most typical business issues (classification of text, imagery or audio data). At first you'll have to look at other people's code and copy/paste/edit/learn/iterate. Also, don't underestimate the complexity of creating good training, validation and potentially test sets.<p>95% of your time will be spent massaging data. People say it so often, it may sound ridiculous, but I promise you, it's not. This skill is also readily transferrable to other domains.</p><p>I would start with classifying text using sklearn and Facebook's Fasttext.</p><p>Then try the dogs/cats image classification challenge and get familiar with Keras and its utilities. I created a few hours of content around recognizing Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos, then trying to recognize 2 types of dog breeds. I outline the challenges of creating "good" training and validation sets.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hffX-jC98&list=PLImyDqSBQbdl_dd5GTZjiUzPZ2-63h10j" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3hffX-jC98&list=PLImyDqSBQb...</a></p><p>For every hour you spend looking at some equations, you missed an hour expanding your skill-set to manipulate and get data into a format which can be fed into well understood and maintained algorithms. Once you feel like you get produce results, go back and think about the underlying mechanics. My 2 cents from experience.

                  This doesn't help answer your question (I don't think) by my observation...<p>I have the same question and I got my degree 12 years ago.</p><p>I remember my AI course in college consisted of implementing a neural net in Lisp and memorizing a ton of dense text.</p><p>It is really easy to take a Tensor flow model someone already wrote and tweak the parameters to make it work for your use case. I think that code reuse and open source is the largest advancement in AI in the last 10 years.</p><p>So a lot of companies can use AI in their products without even really knowing how it work.</p><p>Now once you start training your own models the hardest part to me is the vocabulary. So many tutorials and classes say "use this algorithm" or "take this code and modify it"... I want to know why I chose that algorithm, what were the other choices, and how do I write that code if I don't have an instructor to do the boilerplate for me. It is very frustrating.</p><p>Hopefully some of the answers here will answer some of those questions.</p><p>As another note, a lot of the advanced AI uses Calculus. algebra is not enough. I don't know what college you went to or what accreditation it has but by third year you should at least have taken Calculus II... maybe even Differential Equations. If you haven't, don't worry, 99% of programming jobs won't use them. But parts of AI will.

Besides that, I think Andrew Ng's Coursera offerings - intro to ML and the newer NN specialization - are great first steps. Personally I have a hard time learning from videos, so I refer to my copy of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop.<p>If you want a linear algebra text, I enjoy Strang's Introduction to Linear Algebra

2) Probability (Harvard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbB0FjPg0mw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbB0FjPg0mw</a> )</p><p>Get some basic grasp of machine learning. Get a good intuition of basic concepts</p><p>1) Andrew Ng coursera course (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning</a>)</p><p>2) Tom Mitchell book (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Tom-M-Mitchell/dp/0070428077" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Tom-M-Mitchell/dp/00...</a>)</p><p>Both the above course and book are super easy to follow. You will get a good idea of basic concepts but they lack in depth. Now you should move to more intense books and courses</p><p>You can get more in-depth knowledge of Machine learning from following sources</p><p>1)Nando machine learning course ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2OtwL5T1ow" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2OtwL5T1ow</a>)</p><p>2)Bishops book (<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.in/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Informati...</a>)</p><p>Especially Bishops book is really deep and covers almost all basic concepts.</p><p>Now for recent advances in Deep learning.

                  Regarding calculus, I think basic multivariable calculus can be enough for starting.

Also, some idea of Hypothesis testing can be helpful

                  I'd personally say it depends on your budget, what you want to do, and the amount of data you plan to process. It may also depend on how comfortable you are setting up your own rig, if you go that route.<p>For instance, last year I completed Udacity's "Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree" course. Large parts of the course needed us to train neural nets (tensorflow and similar) on data we either generated or downloaded. We were provided the option to use AWS instances for training (free credits), but I opted to use my local box.</p><p>It took me about a day or so of playing around before I finally got everything working properly (CUDA, etc) with my NVidia 750ti GPU. This is a very low-end GPU, but it honestly performed quite well for the course. It could only handle a limited amount of data, and sometimes training cycles took a while for turnaround (depending on the task), but it ran the resulting models quite easily (while still handling the 3D rendering tasks of the vehicle simulator).</p><p>For learning purposes, it will all depend - if you already have a machine with a decent GPU, CPU and RAM (say something equivalent to the 750 or better, 4 cores or more, and say 8 gig of RAM), it might make sense to try to do things locally - if you think your skills are up to the configuration challenges (I got my system working, but I ended up breaking Ubuntu's update system, because I'm on 14.04 LTS, and I had to hand-install many things to fix dependencies and such for Python, Tensorflow, C/C++, etc - in order to complete the course).</p><p>However, if you are planning on processing a huge amount of data for a large model, but aren't planning on doing this constantly - then an AWS instance might be a better option, as a custom rig for this kind of thing I'd imagine would be a bear to spec out and configure - not to mention cost.</p><p>I'm certainly not an expert on all of this, though...ymmv.
