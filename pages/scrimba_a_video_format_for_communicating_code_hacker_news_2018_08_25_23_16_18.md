                  The console button isn't working for me on some of the codecasts. I'm using macOS Chrome Version 56.0.2924.87 (64-bit). Not sure if this is because I have set an unusual Content Security Policy for chrome. Here's what I see in my browser's console when watching<pre><code>  Blocked script execution in 'https://scrimba.com/cast/cast-327.preview' because the document's frame is sandboxed and the 'allow-scripts' permission is not set.

                  Y apply to YC. If ur serious about anything and ur a serious developer, u don't need money, connections, etc. Y dilute yourself, Y forever be beholden to investors. I know I don't want anyone telling me what to do regarding my baby.<p>Programming apps is quicker than ever now. All you need is a ramen noodle revenue stream to keep you afloat while you build.</p><p>I urge you to question why you really wanna go to YC. Is it to get consigned by "daddy"? It sure can feel good. It's an accomplishment of it's own, but a sub-par intention.</p><p>You got this far, why not monetize on your own so you can support yourself through your product, and never have to give up any equity and rights to decision making for YOUR COMPANY!</p><p>Too many people are eager to allow others to have a say on their baby. Don't do it unless you absolutely need to. Start charging. I'll pay for this product. Forget YC. Believe in yourself. Are you a follower that eagerly seeks direction from others or a leader who just knows what must be done and doesn't look to others for validation. Validation seekers will always fare less well because they are less confident. So the question is: why are you not confident in yourselves? Why is this going to fail if you don't go to YC? To put the question in the positive, how could you get to where you wanna go and farther without YC?? What do you need? Is it just ramen noodle revenue for you guys while you build? If so, maybe there are other ways. Have you even tried to explore them?

                  Fair points, the reason is simply because I think we'll be able to build a bigger company if we join YC. Specifically, the pie will grow more than the 7% YC takes from it.<p>But I might be wrong of course.

                  Let me just add my two cents, having gone both routes. The mantra you will hear all day long is exactly that...  Wouldn't you rather have a smaller piece of a huge pie than a big piece of a small pie?<p>But I would urge you to weigh things out.  That first 7% is just the beginning.  They will urge you to hire the best and brightest, time is of the essence. They will tell you not to worry about money, more VC money will flow. And then you find yourself with a big payroll and the need to raise another round, and then another, and then another.  Before you know it, you've built the $100 million business you always wanted, but you aren't in charge any more and you own maybe 10 percent. Dilution happens faster than you realize. (Unless your growth is off the charts and you can negotiate amazing terms because VCs are falling over themselves to give you money, ala facebook.)</p><p>At that point the question becomes, would you rather have a hundred percent of a $10 million business or 10 percent of a $100m business?  I sure as heck would rather own all of the smaller business.  You don't go to the board to ask for a raise, you don't hope for a liquidity event so you can get rich one day.  You don't waste time trying to convince investors that you will succeed.  You control your destiny.</p><p>But to each his own. Maybe you would never be able to get to that $10m on your own. And maybe you would rather be known as the founder of something big. Nothing wrong with that. Just know that the headaches and distractions of going the VC route are legion.

                  I've never applied to YC but that isn't totally correct.  There's no one forcing you to raise venture capital.  I know of YC companies who are quite successful who have never raised money or stopped after raising a smallish angel round and still own a majority of their company.  Granted they're in the minority, but it can be done.

                  Ya, it definitely happens.  But if the company didn't need to move on to raise more money (probably the biggest argument for YC is that it will be easier to raise more), I would question whether YC was really necessary in the first place.  Was YC the only place you could have raised $100k?  And if you were able to do it by raising only 100k, perhaps you could have done it without their money.

                  1 billion percent agree with this sentiment. It's all a trick. It's all perception. It's all egos at play that want to be validated by larger egos. You're a friggin fantastic coder. You can build something that YC will accept. And you're choosing to complicate your lives, introduce all these players you just met into your circle, etc. For what? Can you really not make a living off your programming chops to sustain your own startup on the side that increasingly takes up more and more of your time as it generates money?<p>If you're not trying to do that, it's solely because you have ego issues and your greedy. Your willing to take this huge risk of a shittier situation with lots of stress and other people telling you what to do to prove to the world how great you are and so you can attain way more than you really need. It's a false a conception of what will make you happy--cuz it wont. I can make $65k a year in the states and live an extravagant life-style, doing all the trips and experiences I want to. All while working primarily on my own stuff and doing minor contracts here and there. I worked very hard to get here and learn these lessons. I used to make way way more, but the quality of my life was worse. I used to pursue startups with partners, making some industry I barely care about more efficient. Now i work on my own project--which for all intents and purposes, let's just say it's a surfing startup. Everything I truly love is aligned with my career skills. It's not a surfing startup, but that should paint the picture. Most of all, I don't have investors down my back, partners I'm constantly disputing with, higher percentages taken away in taxes, and generally a million unnecessary people to deal with. And actually more importantly, I'm not building some bullshit like Uber which has nothing to do with my interests. I love to code, but i think if anyone loves coding more than traveling, hanging out with friends, being in the world, you have a problem. What I'm saying is: if you're building Uber, you don't love taxis, you just better hope you're solving interesting problems. And "interesting problems" is far less interesting than traveling to Machu Pichu with my girlfriend and taking ayahuasca in the Amazon (for example).</p><p>Programming is a means to an end, not the end in itself. Programming isn't life. It's far from it. Building software companies and the business side is even farther. Those guys are going to YC for ego and greed, and like 90% will pay the price and likely fail, whereas they could have something bringing them income and quality of life right now. They could already be at the end of the road and living in the now, i.e. having a functioning product that doesn't need to go even farther to be labeled a success. If they could live off their product right now, they would be a success. The route they're gonna go--as you mentioned--will lead to more and more rounds and likely never achieving a state they're happy with. It's the essence of the human condition and addiction. It's nothing unique to startups, programmers and YC. They just would be way happier if they simplified their life. Like everyone, they'll have to find out the hard way though and complicate their life to the extreme before they realize.

                  If you provided an embeddable iframe widget that I could put on my own site, and intercept the file changes to do my own rendering, something like:<pre><code>    &lt;script src="http://scrimba.com/widget.js"&gt;
    scrimbaWidget(".my-container", "sc-ri-mbaID", function onFileChanged(name, source, output) {
      persistToMyBackend(name, source)
      output.innerHTML = renderFromMyServer(name)
    })
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
... this would be a very interesting platform play. You would be providing essentially the audio, text capture, and synchronization, but I could keep doing my app hosting. Not having to store audio or deal with browser incompatibilities around recording and playback would be worth some money to me.<p>Like Filestack for screen recording.

                  I really like the idea and I expect to see a lot of great tutorials in this format.
I would really use a version that works with tmux or iterm though, something like asciinema but for multiple terminals + a browser. I wouldn't even mind if the result is read only as long as the viewer can copy paste from it.<p>Edit: Just to add one more note: I know recording terminal and chrome at the same time is too complicated to productize, but I wouldn't mind having to set it up. I am a developer. I set things up.

                  This is a wonderful idea and execution.<p>Tip for people trying this out, to experience it fully you have to:</p><p>- login with github
- edit some text
- then hit play again. The preview will then update.</p><p>- also, you can record your own edits to the video.</p><p>I am surprised by the quality and thoughtful demos.</p><p>Some simple things would make it better, like updating automatically without hitting play. Also, I think the videos should have x buttons to close them, not just clicking in another area.

                  Nice to hear you praise the quality. We haven't spent a lot of time on producing the current casts, it's just that the tool makes it easy to create casts of high-production value. No more fiddling with screen-recording software and post-production. It makes a big difference when you can go from "I want to explain this" to a finished cast in three minutes.<p>The "casts are shown in an overlay"-feature was released yesterday. It certainly requires more iterations. Thanks for the feedback.

                  Neat! The audience for the tool seems to be someone who can hear, though. Has there been any awareness or discussion of those who cannot hear? Of those that cannot hear, a large majority use captioning or sign language. Video in a PIP mode, or captioning support, would go a long way in including everyone to the party. Also, the earlier these features are added, the more content is accessible.

                  Very cool.<p>In the last few weeks I've been thinking something similar would be great for podcasts. Not on-screen editing, but tools for displaying information and soliciting feedback.</p><p>In my case I've been listening to a lot of podcasts about real estate. Frequently they reference a PDF or web site to sign up for more info. It would be nice if that just showed up onscreen rather than having to open a browser on my phone (especially when I'm in the car).</p><p>Dedicated apps can do this, of course, but I an open protocol would have a lot more uptake from semi-technical people who want to create simple online course distributed via podcast.

                  There is so much opportunity for learning here... I agree, I wish podcasts had some kind of technology that allowed you to follow things that are hard to convey through Audio.

                  I once started writing a podcast app like that. As a listener I would reallly like the idea. Unfortunately I don't see why a podcaster would do the job of adding metadata on my platform if they don't get anything out of it. If it was a core of their value proposition, they would probably use a mooc platform and not a podcast.<p>Then I though I would probably need to build a more useful tool to manage other needs of a publisher, like website, feed generation, pushing to multiple platforms, etc. That way I would have all sorts of metadata for free AND I would provide value to the publishers (automatic publishing to all other platforms). I could host the content too and give them download numbers, could post listening habits from my app, and all that.
But that is a lot of work though, before I can provide any value to either the listeners or the publishers.</p><p>Then I listened to a podcast about the podcast ecosystem (how meta) about
how podcasters actually benefit from the ecosystem being so distributed.
If there was a single format for metadata dictated by a single company (would probably be apple) it would eat into their advertising revenue. They would not admit it, but it's actually good for publishers if they only have rough download numbers. Without clicks, they can just make up their numbers, and sell ads even though everyone fast forwards on the ads. If they had actual clicks, their revenue would become dependent on it.

                  For sponsored podcasts you're right. But much of what I listen to doesn't have advertising, or it's indirect in the form of interviewing guests who promote their products.<p>For example, one of the  podcasts I really like is run by a guy who a) knows a lot about real estate and b) sells a SaaS product for people who want to do what he does. He frequently references show notes, PDFs, webinar signups and the like in his show, and I engage with most of that stuff... if I remember to do it when I get home.</p><p>In his case the value per customer is quite high, so he would probably make the investment in rich media. He doesn't have sponsors and so isn't beholden to click through rates.</p><p>And I'd wager that's true for the vast majority of podcasts. A handful make money from advertising because they have really large audiences. The rest do it as a hobby or to promote their businesses.

                  Thanks. Yes, other (server-side) languages are definitely coming. We're currently working with a prototype that integrates with Jupyter/IPython, and we're also playing with the idea of using Docker images for giving a full terminal. The biggest challenge is to give a powerful execution environment <i>and</i> make it easy for the viewer to play with the code and be able to run it.

                  Just to post in blogs, github pages, etc. I'm biased but I think you would get free marketing if people embed it, and a paid feature for people to keep them private (password locked, whatever).<p>That way people who publish free educational content (freecodeacademy, me - example, a todo app tutorial: <a href="http://gun.js.org/think.html" target="_blank">http://gun.js.org/think.html</a> , etc.) would spread scrimba awareness. The inverse, sites that charge for classes - Udemy, etc., have a natural incentive to keep their content secret, which they'd have to pay for.

                  Yeah I saw that , little bit too minimal to be honest , doesn't scream "click me" so was a bit confused initially. Though it was just another play button for the video. Maybe moving it to the output window would be a bit less confusing

I cannot wait for the "everything needs to be a small looping video clip" fad to go away.<p>Video clips of typing make no sense.  The animation is distracting, it provides no useful information, and they <i>always</i> either loop too quickly (frustrating me because I lose my place and have to wait for the whole thing to come back), or go too slowly (frustrating me because it won't hurry up).  A 3 second loop is great for a hamster meme, it's not great for displaying text that I want to read.</p><p>It's like an entire group of people completely misunderstood why GIF animations were despised and died off.</p><p>Seriously, what value are these video clips adding?
&lt;/rant&gt;
