Over the last 6 months, I've been building a lightweight automation tool called plainflow.com<p>It's cool because empowers teams to build complex use cases that aren't doable with traditional old-school marketing automation products.

I spent 3 months scraping 6 million pages from an extremely old political web forum (I think their backend was written in perl and hasn't been updated since 2001 and the response times for these pages were extremely high) in an effort to learn NLP stuff with a working database. Its cool because you get to see how old Boomers digested huge events during 9/11 up until now and the slow decline of web forums as a medium. The pain is trying to parse the actual pages since the dev never learned how to liberally use div tags like we do now.

I once scraped a large forum off Yuku, the HTML was easily the most bizarre I've ever seen (i.e. multiple different HTML formats for posts on the same page for no apparent reason).

Hey Kyle, this looks nice. I use RescueTime[1] for this purpose on desktop, but since it doesn't easily interop with mobile/other devices, it's still easy to slip into procrastination by pulling out the phone. I'll try TimeGuard as a way to fill the gap.</p><p>For me, the killer feature for this type of tool would be a blanket anti-procrastination mode that works across all devices. Maybe it could even make sense to integrate somehow at the router level?</p><p>1 - <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/" target="_blank">https://www.rescuetime.com/</a>

I just redesigned what an offer letter looks like. [1] I think it's cool for a few different reasons: (1) most people don't truly understand the value behind an offer from a startup. Equity for example is tricky for newcomers. (2) Most companies don't share this information unless you push them on it. I wish more companies would be transparent about it, and I think doing this will help.</p><p>Here's a demo: <a href="https://coinbase.onsites.co/o/aurora-h" target="_blank">https://coinbase.onsites.co/o/aurora-h</a></p><p>I also redesigned the onsite experience.

Hi:))</p><p>Thanks:)</p><p>So I just broke those this week with an update & some refactoring, but they are for soundscapes, like rain, ocean, cafe background noise ect. - still thinking about how to group things</p><p>You know, open sourcing with multiple devs is something I haven’t put much thought into - at least for this project. I will have to move around some configs and do some readme stuff but growing that collaboration muscle seems important. Ill let that stir in my head, its still my baby, but I don’t see any harm, so maybe in a little:)</p><p>Soundcloud is a great idea:) I didn’t think of that either! - probably bc I don’t use it enough. Im definitely going to look into that this weekend.</p><p>Thanks and I’m really glad u guys like it this made my day:)

No link, as this is a scratch my own itch thing for now, but I'm working on a personal 'hub' web app that is part UX/UI experiment, and part a way to integrate various tools I've created over the years to ease various pain points in my life.</p><p>Some of this has to do with solving the problem of the deluge of information I consume, through psychological 'intervention' as well as some way to store all this stuff and make it easy to filter and find the useful bits.</p><p>Some of it is journalling-related, and vaguely in the Quantified Self area.</p><p>A significant portion is about finding ways to actually use this amazing, powerful computer that I have in my pocket for things that actually, quantifiably, provably improve my life (and hopefully, eventually, that of others). This is mostly in the direction of autism-related issues, anxiety, maintaining social connections, and so on. Applying the (relatively) well-supported lessons from psychology to the bafflingly advanced technology that is part of my daily life, and that of most people around me.</p><p>Mostly it's a vanity project though, that I can currently afford indulging in. I figure that after years of working and making money off building stuff I don't care about much, it's time to let my more creative side express itself in ways that might prove useful somehow. I'm not an painter, or a musician, or a poet, but I can code, I love to code (when it's on my own terms), and I'm still amazed that for less than five bucks I can have a server running that does whatever I want it to do, and as a 'full-stack developer', that's quite a lot!</p><p>Part of me wants to work on things that are more directly beneficial to others, but 1) I have enough 'runway' to do that too, eventually, and 2) I've grown weary of always trying to make sure that what I do is 'useful' by some measure that doesn't quite feel like it originates from within. Many of the best things I've done started out as scratches to personal itches, so perhaps it's okay to 'indulge' for now.

This sounds interesting! I think I’m jealous, sounds like you have some real space to explore and craft and that’s where happiness can be found!

On some level I feel this question is just here to advertise the poster's project.</p><p>I think it would have been better if they had put their project in the comments like everyone else instead of giving themselves more visibility by putting it in the main question.</p><p>They may not have intended it this way - but it's possible.

Funnily enough I overlooked the short text until you mentioned it.
