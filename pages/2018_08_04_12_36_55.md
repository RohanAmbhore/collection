          <p>What is the best practice for deleting items from the apollo store when a mutation deletes them on the server? I could not find anything related to this in the docs. Do I just have to return ids of deleted items as a result of mutation and then use reducer/updatequeris to manually delete items from the store? Or there is some way to let apollo client handle it automatically? Any help is appreciated.</p>

How about the option of creating a function that removes an object based on the data-id? In this way I can just call that function after delete to clear it from the local cache, it might even be called automatically if the mutation returns null or so?</p>

          <p>We are missing one big use case when frontend can not determine results of what queries and how were changed after deletion (same applies for creating new entities). Let's say I queried <code>users(age=29, limit=20, offset=10, sort='name')</code>.<br />
Then I sent mutation to delete some user. And now I can not use <code>reducer</code> or <code>updateQueries</code> because I don't know HOW should I change results of users query. Only server knows how to filter users based on provided variables.<br />
The only thing I can do is to invalidate somehow cache for all <code>users</code> queries. But as far as I know there is no way to do it in Apollo. Am I right?</p>

          <p><a href="https://github.com/nosovsh" target="_blank">@nosovsh</a> You can invalidate the entire cache, for everything, on a delete. That's what I ended up going with as a solution, though in my application deletes are a rarity anyways (i.e. perhaps once a week for a user at most).</p>
<p>Yes, it would be really nice if there was a way to invalidate a single item using the object ID the store is using to keep track of it, across all possible queries that would be including it. I tried to suss out exactly how the application is keying the cache for objects, and why all the solutions seem to couple it with the query (it must not be simple key/value, or these suggested workarounds would be total overkill), but after about an hour of digging into the code, I eventually just decided to go with the nuke option.</p>
<p>A clear explanation of the store and cache invalidation strategies would be quite welcome - as someone that isn't particularly familiar with Relay, I feel like most of the examples/discussion/documentation on the Apollo internal cache assumes a strong familiarity with Relay's store, and how it's plugged into Apollo.</p>
<p>For example, it wasn't clear at all to me if I zap a cached item from one query, if it zaps it from other queries that would return it, or if on deletion I need to essentially loop over every possible query that would return it and check if it's in the cache, and if so, zap it for each query. And if zapping it once zaps it everywhere, I'm again confused why I can't just zap it directly using the objectID generated to track it.</p>

          <p>(Please tell me if my question would be better asked in SO instead.)</p>
<p>I was using <code>updateQueries</code> to delete from the store but it only works for the current parameters in a query and I'm deleting data for other cached parameters (ie. I filter by month and I'd like to delete data from multiple months). Anyone knows the recommended way to do this (without refetching)?</p>
<p>Plus, I thought migrating to the new <code>update</code> API could give me more flexibility on this matter, but I couldn't find any doc about <strong>deleting</strong> from the store when using <code>update</code>. What is the recommended way to do this? Does it support the case I described above?</p>

<p>I don't really need to "delete from the cache" but this is the way that worked so far for me when deleting something from the view.</p>
<p>I've a list of items in my React view injected by Apollo. When I execute a mutation that deletes one item how do I remove that specific item from my view? So far I've been deleting it from the cache using the <code>updateQueries</code> method.</p>
<p>However, the last query I'm working on has a month parameter and I can navigate through months so they become cached by Apollo. I've a mutation that deletes some items that affects multiple months, not only the currently active parameter. The <code>updateQueries</code> method only affects the active parameter so when I navigate to other months after this mutation, the old cache (before the delete operation) is loaded.</p>
<p>If you don't delete from the cache in these situations, what is the solution? Just invalidate the cache or refetch?</p>

          <p>I am confused. Most of the sample code I see on this thread, seems to deal with running a delete mutation from a single query. What if I actually have multiple queries referencing that object? I thought the whole point of Apollo tracking refs ie Type-X was to handle such a use case.</p>
<p>For example say user deletes User-1. User-1 is referenced by multiple queries say queryA and queryB. Based on what I see in this thread, it seems it would be the responsibility of the component update to correctly update the store for each of the referencing queries??</p>
<p>I hope I a missing the point here as this would be a maintenance nightmare! So getting back to the original question: What is the best way to handle this use case ie delete the reference and have apollo remove the reference from ALL queries tracking that instance?</p>

          <p><a href="https://github.com/derailed" target="_blank">@derailed</a> a few thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The store is only going to save the user as one item in the cache so even if multiple queries are returning the user, it should only need to be removed once. If you haven't already, try out the Chrome Apollo extension, which will allow you to see how the store is updated post mutation.</li>
<li>If there are items in the store related to the user such as BlogUser, ToDoUser, etc., those would most likely need to be explicitly removed from the store within the "update" section of the mutation.</li>
<li>Generally, mutations are only going to impact a small number of tables, in which case the mutation update of the store makes sense. However, if a particular mutation is going to have wide ranging affects, you could consider resetting the entire store with <a href="http://dev.apollodata.com/react/auth.html#login-logout" target="_blank">client.resetStore()</a>. It's documented as part of the login/logout functionality, but it can be used elsewhere.</li>

          <div>Hi Chris,

  Thank you for the reply! I am at loss here. I have a bunch of queries
falling in this use case ie referencing a user
  object. I am indeed using the extension and it seems to report the
correct behavior per the implementation ie the user object is deleted from
the query but still shows on the left handside under the store tab aka
`Apollo Client State, which leaves me to believe that user is still in the
store. So as you can see my update cb currently deletes the user from the
current query and not the actual store. Not sure how do actually to this??

  As you can see here 3 other queries references that user and need to be
updated. I haven't yet found a way to deal with that elegantly besides
having to refetch to make sure that user is now gone in related queries.
That said my update scenarios work ie on an update mutation the user
changes are correctly propagated which leads me to believe the store is
actually wired correctly?

  My expectations here is during a delete mutation all the queries having
the referenced user object should be "automatically" deleted without having
to manually update all related queries as the reference is no longer
active. Per your <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/2" target="_blank">#2</a> point it does not seems to be handled by Apollo that
way.  Hence to currently get the right effect and short of either reseting
or refetching one is left with having to know all the potential queries
that might be affected by that deletion.
Does this sound right, or am I missing it?

Thank you for you clarifications!!

  Here is what I have in my code when a user is deleted:

this.apollo.mutate({
mutation: DeleteUser,
variables: deleteInputs(this.user.id),
// BOZO!! Lame!
refetchQueries: [{ query: Facilities }, { query: Accounts }, { query:
OrphanUsers }],
optimisticResponse: optimisticDelete(id),
update: (store: any, data: any) =&gt; {
const cache = store.readQuery({ query: PvdmUsers });
store.writeQuery({
query: PvdmUsers,
data: {
pvdmUsers: _.filter(cache.pvdmUsers, (u: UserFragment): boolean =&gt; { return
u.id != id })
}
});
}
})
.toPromise()
.then(() =&gt; this.back())
.catch(error =&gt; this.error = error.message);</div>

<p>I believe, the user is correctly removed from the query but not from the store. I think I am<br />
not understanding out to actually remove my user from the store. This code works for the<br />
users query. However I have 2 other query referencing that user and the given user still show<br />
in those.</p>
<p>So I think my confusion here is I expect the delete to be propagated to the other queries since<br />
it's a delete mutation, but don't think that's the way things actually work. But perhaps I am<br />
totally missing the point here??</p>
<p>Here is the code</p>
<div><pre>   this.apollo.mutate({
      mutation: DeleteUser,
      variables: deleteInputs(this.user.id),
      // BOZO!! Lame!

<p>One thing just dawned on me. I think a delete mutation does not have any special meaning in Apollo, it's just a mutation. Thus it would be the resp of the dev on the update to make sure the deletion is correctly propagated across all queries referencing it. I think this is why I have been struggling with this concept as I thought given the special handling of refs that though regular mutation works nicely, in a delete situation special care must be taken to ensure the store integrity. I hope I am wrong about this, but if not this is going to be very painful...</p>

          <p><a href="https://github.com/derailed" target="_blank">@derailed</a> No you're right. With a normal mutation (create or update), you get the created/updated Object back as a response, so Apollo knows how to handle it (in most cases). When deleting an object, Apollo doesn't know what to do (yet), so we have to specify it ourself in the <code>update</code> method we provide.<br />
If Apollo would automatically delete the object from the store, that could always break several things.</p>
<p>For instance when you have queries <code>ListAllUsers</code> and <code>ListAdminUsers</code>, where <code>User:1</code> is in both lists and Apollo then deleted <code>User:1</code> from the store, then de references would be deleted in both queries.<br />
But what if we have another query <code>ListBlogPost</code>s, where you have the following:</p>
<div><pre>query {
  ListBlogPosts () {
    id
    title
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}</pre></div>
<p>Apollo can't know what to do (unless we tell it). Does it also delete all the <code>Blogpost</code>s?, does it only delete the reference to the deleted user?<br />
That's why we have to specify it ourself in the <code>update</code> method.</p>
<p>I know it can be cumbersome if you have a lot of references to the deleted <code>User</code>, but that's (currently) the only way to handle it I think.</p>
<p>Maybe <a href="https://github.com/helfer" target="_blank">@helfer</a> and/or <a href="https://github.com/stubailo" target="_blank">@stubailo</a> can correct me if I'm wrong?</p>

I was hoping there was a better solution here as I am going to need to a) figure out which queries are active during the delete. b) for each active query traverse to see if that user is actually referenced c) delete the ref d) update the store. Lots of manual operation here especially in lite of new features creeping in and introduction new refs to users, that will need to update that delete operation.</p>

Right now you'll have to delete the reference from all queries that use it. A simpler way is to refetch all the queries that could reference that object, which you could even do as part of the mutation, if you wanted to (in that case it would be called a "fat query").</p>
<p>If we added a special <code>store.deleteObject</code> functionality or something like that, it could work by automatically removing all references or simply marking the object as deleted and then not including it in lists etc. any more. The question is what should happen to queries that now have incomplete data. Most likely the best we could do is return <code>null</code> in that case.</p>

          <p>I thought about the ability to use directives in order to mark mutations. E.g. <code>@delete</code>. then the mutation would return either null or the Id of the object that should get deleted. In case of a mutation that deletes multiple items the mutation could return a list of IDs. We could then either implement this in Apollo or as a plugin, I did not check out Apollo 2 yet so I can not tell where it would fit in best.</p>
<p>Any suggestions or opinions on this approach? <g-emoji>ð</g-emoji></p>

          <p>Certainly performing a mutation and then expecting that to be able to correctly update all active queries is ...ambitious.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how many cases it works for, but I think using soft deletes might be a solution for some people.</p>
<p>Imagine a user:</p>
<pre><code>{
   id: 123,
   name: "John Doe",
   email: "john@doe.com",
}
</code></pre>
<p>and maybe a message</p>
<pre><code>{
  id: 456,
  text: "a witty comment",
  author {
    id: 123
    ...
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then John Doe wants to delete his account so return a mutation with a result e.g.</p>
<pre><code>{
   id: 123,
   name: "[deleted]",
   email: null,
   deleted: true
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then it's up to components displaying users to decide if they want to check if <code>deleted</code> is set or not. For instance the posts in a forum may remain with the user name set to [deleted], but sending a private message would not be allowed.</p>
<p>This problem is not limited to deletes, imagine an insert which affects the results of many queries as well.</p>
<p>If you are using react and find yourself in the situation where you are performing a mutation and you know that this is going to possibly affect a number of active queries, on many components, then you may decide to move the network level fetching out of the HOC wrapping your components to somewhere else, and have your HOC have a fetchPolicy of 'cache-only'.</p>
<p>In this case you need to perform the fetching logic somewhere else, good candidates for this are redux-observable or redux-saga.</p>

<p>I have a removeItemFromQuery helper which is nearly identical to unshiftItemToQuery.  Created the helpers and use the "self" const etc. as we have (right now) 20+ mutations this can run on and duplicating this in every mutation was a logistical nightmare.  The removals that are happening in the updateQueries call now can (and will) be moved into update and handled the same way... If you're doing infinite scroll or any type of query pagination, connections are a must!</p>

          <p>I finally found a solution for my case with multiple queries. There is a race condition when using <code>refetchQueries</code> and <code>updateQuery</code> in a mutation . Seems like <code>updateQuery</code> removing the object form the Apollo store needs to be called before <code>refetchQueries</code>.</p>
<p>In my case the I have many different queries (sorting/filtering) objects.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>latestSongs</code></li>
<li><code>featuredSongs</code></li>
<li><code>mostViewedSongs</code></li>
<li><code>mostRemixedSongs</code></li>
<li>...  and more... generals and specifics per user</li>
</ul>
<p>The user can access the detail view of an object from any list to remove an object using a mutation. When the object is deleted from database I need to update the detail view to redirect out and also the query results for each list which could contain that object.</p>
<p>I don't want to remove the object manually from each list with <code>update</code> or <code>updateQueries</code> or reset the whole store so my option is to use <code>refetchQueries</code> to get the new lists and <code>updateQuery</code> to remove the object reference from the Apollo store:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>refetchQueries</code> <strong>doesn't work</strong> the queries are refetched and the lists returned don't have the removed object but Apollo still grab the data from the store and shows the removed object in the lists</li>
<li><code>updateQuery</code>  <strong>doesn't work</strong> the query <code>Song:id</code> is updated but Apollo doesn't understand that this reference <code>Song:id</code> is in the other queries (the lists)</li>
</ul>
<p>If I wait for the server response to remove the object reference from the store the queries are refetched but the UI still shows the removed object in the lists.<br />
Updating the object reference after the mutation promise is resolved <strong>doesn't work</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>    removeSongMutation({id})
       .then(() =&gt; updateQuery(() =&gt; ({ song: null })))
</code></pre>
<p>Updating the object reference before <code>refetchQueries</code> <strong>works</strong></p>
<pre><code>    updateQuery(() =&gt; ({ song: null })
    removeSongMutation({id})
</code></pre>
<p>The UI is updated correctly with the data from the lists refetched (not from the store). This is a kind of optimistic response because I'm updating the reference in the store before the object is removed from database.</p>
<pre><code>"apollo-client": "^2.0.4",
"react-apollo": "^2.0.4",
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

      <td>

          <p>We tried a different way by making use of a query's <code>fetchPolicy</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>reduce complexity of <code>refetchQueries</code> by refetching only the currently displayed query(s). In other words only what is currently visible on the page. Queries do not re-fetch at mutation time unless their data is visible to the user. A "dirty" query however refetches from the network on next invocation.</li>
<li>reduce the complexity of tracking all queries that need to be re-fetched. Each query should know at fetch time if it needs to re-fetch from the server or it can just hit the cache (although a mutation still needs to know the name of each query that it will impact).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brief explanation</strong></p>
<p>We have a <code>booksQuery</code> that feeds an infinite scroll of <code>Book</code>s. At the same time it can be filtered by the user with various arguments. So invalidating and re-fetching ALL the query / filter combinations can get really expensive.</p>
<p>We looked at a query's <code>fetchPolicy</code> and switching it dynamically between <code>cache-first</code> and <code>network-only</code>. This way we can force a query to refetch from the server if it is <em>dirty</em>.</p>
<p>To achieve this we need a <code>queryCache</code> where to track each query by name and the input filters that it has already fetched. Every time a query runs it gets its <code>fetchPolicy</code> from the <code>queryCache</code>. (we're using typescript but it works just the same in ES6 without the typings).</p>
<p>The sequence is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>mutation: invalidate all related queries (by name) on the <code>queryCache</code></li>
<li>query: next time the query runs it gets its <code>fetchPolicy: "network-only"</code> from the <code>queryCache</code></li>
<li>on query completion: clean the <code>queryCache</code> for the query to prevent it from going to the network on every subsequent invocation. This causes the <code>queryCache</code> to return <code>fetchPolicy:"cache-first"</code> on subsequent calls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Connected component query:</p>
<div><pre>const BookFeedContainer = graphql(
   BookQueries.bookFeed,
   {
      options: (props: IOwnProps) =&gt; {
         const bookFilter: InputBookFilter = props.bookFilter;
         
         // BookQueries is a namespace under which we host all 
         // BookQuery graphql related info (fragments, queries, mutations, types etc)
         const queryName = BookQueries.names.bookFeed;
         const inputKey = InputBookFilter.toKey(bookFilter);
         
         // every time the query runs its fetch policy is determined by the queryCache
         const fetchPolicy = queryCache.getFetchPolicy(queryName, inputKey);

         return ({
           variables: {
             bookFilter: props.bookFilter,
           },
           fetchPolicy,
         });
      },
   }
)(BookFeed);</pre></div>
<p>Somewhere else in the app a mutation occurs:</p>
<div><pre>handleClickDeleteBook = () =&gt; {
    this.props.deleteBook()
      .then((result: any) =&gt; {
        // invalidate (refetch) all related queries if the deletion succeeds
        // this causes the queryCache to provide a "network-only" fetchPolicy
        // the next time the bookFeed query runs
        // NOTE that this does NOT cause the query to be invoked right away
        // if you need the query update to run immediately you must still call updateQueries
        // we do that on queries that are visible on the page
        queryCache.refetch([BookQueries.names.bookFeed]);

        // ... rest of code
      })
      .catch(err =&gt; {
        console.error(getGraphQLErrorMessage(err));
  }</pre></div>
<p>Query cleanup - most likely in <code>componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)</code> once the query has finished executing</p>
<div><pre>queryCache.clean(BookQueries.names.bookFeed);</pre></div>
<p><strong>Query Filtering</strong></p>
<p>Each query has a list of input ids (inputKey in our case) keyed in on the query cache by query name:</p>
<div><pre>queryCache = {
  [queryName:string]: Array&lt;inputKey:string&gt;
}</pre></div>
<p>If an input filter's key is in the query's cached list then the query / inputFilter combination is "clean" and can be fetched from the cache (with fallback to network = default apollo config). If the input filter's key is NOT in the list or the list is missing from the cache then the query / filter combination is dirty and it must be fetched from the network. <code>fetchPolicy: network-only</code>.</p>
<p>This design allows to mark all query / filter combinations as dirty (either on a delete or add op) by just deleting the query's list of input keys (note that I do not need to know all the filter keys that the user might have accessed):</p>
<div><pre>import queryCache from "query-cache"; // this is a singleton

const queryName1 = "BookQueries_bookFeed"
const queryName2 = "SomeOtherRelatedQuery_name"

// this invalidates each queryName's list on the cache thus forcing 
// ALL combinations of each query to be refetched from the network on next call
queryCache.refetch([queryName1, queryName2]); </pre></div>
<p>Then when executing the query I can retrieve the fetch policy directly from the queryCache:</p>
<div><pre>const fetchPolicy1 = queryCache.getFetchPolicy(queryName1, inputKey); // cache-first or network-only

// or without filtering
const fetchPolicy2 = queryCache.getFetchPolicy(queryName2); </pre></div>
<p><strong>Detailed code</strong></p>
<p>queryCache.ts:</p>
<div><pre>/**

<p>The next challenge I see is how to handle a delete / creation in a list where a user has already downloaded a very long list of (paged) items. Do we re-fetch the entire list or just part of it based on some form of cursor data?</p>
<p>For deletes: this is where I feel it would be useful to be able to evict an item from the apollo cache and have all queries containing it update locally to reflect the removal. Having some experience with writing a client side cache I am aware of the complexities and risks of inconsistency that this can introduce in the data. However it's a very high value add if implemented properly.</p>

          <p>In prisma they support the <a href="https://www.prismagraphql.com/docs/reference/prisma-api/concepts-utee3eiquo#transactional-mutations" target="_blank">transactional mutations</a> concept, basically cascading deletes with the directive (<code>@relation(â¦, onDelete: CASCADE)</code>).</p>
<p>Maybe apollo should retrieve those logics and apply those rules for the cache so whenever a node is deleted from the cache (using <code>options.update()</code>, its relations based on those transactional rules will be deleted as well.</p>
<p>Obviously this could only work with Prisma in the first place, but it can open a chapter to support other backend framework and database (at the end Prisma uses MySQL and cascading deletes is nothing unfamiliar for most of the DB engines)</p>

          <blockquote>
<p>The store is only going to save the user as one item in the cache so even if multiple queries are returning the user, it should only need to be removed once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is actually not true.  If there are multiple queries, with different parameters, that return a list of items, each one will have a different list of result item IDs in the cache, because the client has no way of knowing which items are included for a given set of parameters.  This is why updates to fields within those items magically work but deletes don't, because the id of the deleted item has to be removed from each of those lists.</p>
<p>But if Apollo merely provided a way to Mark a given typename/id pair as invalidated, it could automatically refetches any queries including that item in their result set.</p>
<p>I have started using helper functions to look through <code>apolloClient.queryManager.queries</code>, checking if a given field is present in the GraphQL <code>selectionSet</code> and if so, refetches the query.  But since these are only active queries, I have to use <code>cache-and-network</code> to ensure that any unmounted components refetch the latest data when they remount.</p>
<p>Next I plan to fetch enough type metadata from the backend to be able to scan all levels of the active queries for the deleted item and refetch any that contain it.</p>

          <p><a href="https://github.com/jedwards1211" target="_blank">@jedwards1211</a> this is a neat idea but would be very chatty and data intensive if there are a lot of updates. We have a chat app that has conversations and it receives messages via subscriptions, if it were to reload all the messages of a conversation every time a new message was added then it would use a lot of data for mobile users, and not be that responsive as it adds another network call when the data is already in the store.</p>
<p>We first solved this using redux-observable and keeping a <code>watchQuery</code> subscribed for each active conversation then updating the watchQuery when a relevant message came in via subscription.</p>
<p>A new approach we are trying is to use our own cache to replace 'apollo-cache-inmemory' which emits a stream of events when new data is written, or update, to the normalised cache. We then have <code>cacheWatchers</code> for queries which might care about the data, and they can update the cache via <code>readQuery()</code> and <code>writeQuery()</code>.</p>
<p>The goal is to have data changes automatically update relevant queries that are saved in the cache, without network fetching.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in this I can share the code but it's at an early stage.</p>

And if a message were deleted, you would delete the <code>message:id</code> cache key and then listeners would pick that up and remove a reference to that key from their lists of results?</p>

My data is very relational, so the number of update cases I would have to handle for each query would break my brain.</p>

          <p><a href="https://github.com/ravenscar" target="_blank">@ravenscar</a> I should also clarify what I'm using the magic refetching for right now in my app: whenever a user creates or deletes an organization, another user, a user group, a device, a device group, etc. or changes associations between them.</p>
<p>These are infrequent operations so the extra refetching is a small price to pay for a strong guarantee of correct updates without handling numerous cases in custom <code>update</code> logic for each of these types in my schema.  Additionally, only one page of results shows onscreen at a time for lists of any of these types, so the amount of data to refetch is well bounded (in general it's good idea to avoid having an unbounded amount of data rendered into the DOM anyway).  In these cases the refetch approach really shines.</p>
<p>In frequent update cases like messages, you're still better off doing something custom.</p>

          <p><a href="https://github.com/jedwards1211" target="_blank">@jedwards1211</a> Hey I'm not saying what you've done is isn't useful - sorry if it came across that way! We did try this initially (refetching active queries) but for us it was too data heavy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It sounds like you would agree with me that custom update logic belongs on the Query components more often than on the Mutation components, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do agree that the logic belongs with the Query and not the Mutation - the update logic in the mutation is ass-backwards in my opinion.</p>
<p>It would be nice if apollo queries had something like reducers which worked on the updates that hit the store, but unfortunately that would probably require some kind of normalisation and I don't think this is a prerequisite for the store (even though that's exactly how it works).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a new message arrives via subscription it gets written to the cache, and then a listener picks that up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a way of detecting changes in the cache and it's exposed as an rxjs observable. This can be subscribed to by many observers which often manage the state of queries, and they add or remove the changed entity from collections.</p>
<p>If you use redux this is somewhat similar to a reducer where the state would be the result of the query and the actions would be the entity changes.</p>
<p>We use a CQRS paradigm not CRUD so it's a bit easier to detect changes, but I don't think that really matters too much.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I really wish I could do is ask the InMemoryCache for all cached items of a given __typename, and then update them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be really nice if <code>readFragment</code> supported this but I suppose it's near impossible unless you have a normalised cache. If you are using <code>apollo-cache-inmemory</code>, which uses a normalised cache, you could write your own version of it and add that functionality quite easily.</p>
<p>Basically roll your own cache like <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/blob/master/packages/apollo-cache-inmemory/src/objectCache.ts" target="_blank">this</a> and track __typenames</p>
<p>When you create the <code>InMemoryCache</code> instance supply a storeFactory in the config which produces your cache.</p>

<p>By far the easiest approach for us has been to have a field on the object called "deleted" then when you delete an object just send it through as <code>deleted : true</code> and everything will update. You need to write your client side container components with this in mind though, so it's definitely no silver bullet.</p>
<p>This all falls into cache invalidation side of the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank">two hard things</a> of computer science and it's seems really difficult (perhaps impossible?) to find a generalised solution.

I mean naively one could think that Apollo could just remove references from all lists.  But if you're using Relay Connections, the reference to an object is not inside a simple list, and an ancestor rather than the reference itself needs to be removed.<br />
Likewise if you have an object type Foo that has one required Bar, and its Bar gets deleted, what do you do?  You can't set its Bar reference to null, that would violate type expectations.  You could delete Foo, but then you've kinda got the same problem as before if anything references Foo...</p>
