                  I feel a little mixed about projects like this.<p>It's fantastic to see people share their knowledge, and turn theory into practice. It's very easy to spout on about best practices and good ideas without demonstrating how they can be implemented in the real world. And this application does demonstrate some good ideas.</p><p>...But some bad ideas also. I think one problem we have in the frontend world is that developers of very small, very simple sites are pulling in solutions entirely unsuited to their scale of problems. They think they are being careful and investing in an insurance against rapid expansion, but what they're actually doing is overspending on the wrong investments, making things expensive that don't need to be expensive, and betting against agility. This seems like a mistake.</p><p>I encounter too many teams who are building web applications by bunding a cornucopia of technologies they don't understand and allow "best practice" examples on GitHub and Medium to do their decision-making for them. They disengage critically from their technology choices, which has the short term benefit of getting them moving faster, but the long term cost of never developing their research and evaluation skills.</p><p>This is not your fault, of course. People always want a silver bullet, a framework prefabricated and ready for drop-in domain code. And to be fair, most websites are very like each other. I just wish software developers chose their tech a little more critically.

                  That's just how we learn to apply things correctly. If the first time you use a tool is to build a scale-appropriate project, you will stumble and likely fail.<p>Imagine you want to sail across the Atlantic and, to acclimate to the necessary tasks, you started small: sailing down the Thames, then sailing to Calais, then sailing farther and into the deeper ocean, before you decide to take the big trip. Now imagine you posted a blog post about this, and the first thing someone pointed out is that you can take the ferry to Calais.</p><p>That's what you've done.

                  &gt; That's just how we learn to apply things correctly.<p>That's fine when we're writing personal projects, but don't professional gigs require a greater standard of care?</p><p>Imagine you need to need to transport water to your home. You start by consulting best practices and blogs and conclude that the only way to take water somewhere is using a helitanker. This is a dual rotor helicopter with an enormous hold. You consult a building planner to construct a helipad on your roof. You seek an expert helicopter pilot. You spend several weeks poring over different models of helicopter.</p><p>You can do a lot of iteration and eventually reach the right result, but that still won't stop your house burning down in this analogy.

                  As a teacher, I appreciate projects like this. The folks in my classes are "amateurs" learning to code. I can, and do, teach them quick ways to build websites, but that won't help them get jobs in the industry. Many people can build sites with those tools. Companies that hire developers are looking for more advanced skills, and examples like this help (hard working) students learn how to use them. It takes my students at least two quarters to get productive with a tool like React, but once they know it, they have a valuable skill and have hopefully learned some important lessons about the proper way to create a robust architecture.

You fixed that pretty good.<p>Disclaimer: I'm on terrible internet connections most of the time and it really makes you hate all this modern web crud. Often "dynamic" sites don't load at all because while the initial HTTP request eventually gets through, one or more of the following XMLHttpRequests or whatever fail, and a lot of the time there is no handler for retries, or no error handler at all, or moronic timeouts (either far too long or far too short).

                  There are some oddly bad tempered responses here. The readme  doesn’t suggest it’s necessarily the best way to implement HN. It’s not an opinion piece. It just lists a bunch of commonly used libraries, and documents rather nicely how to put them together.<p>I can see some value in describing alternative or better ways to do what this web app does, or of critiquing the particular way the components are used. But rants about hating the js ecosystem or this HN implementation just makes it seem like you’ve had a horrible day at work. OK if that’s the case, we’re sorry. Go out for a run or a drink.

                  Apollo manages your data store automatically. It uses Redux internally. Because Apollo wraps the queries and mutations, it smartly caches data and only fetches the minimal amount necessary to build the page. Apollo reduces the amount of Redux CRUD boiler plate dramatically (by as much as 2/3 or more).<p>There are no traps there, everything is configurable. The documentation is really clean. Highly recommend Apollo.</p><p>Once you have this stack wired up, it empowers you to be quite nimble with your development.

                  If you include enough in your definition of side effect, everything must have a side effect. Otherwise you wouldn’t be doing it. A pure function that adds two numbers and returns the result has left your system in a different state than it was in before it ran.<p>Data binding has side effects and the implementation of the thing doing the binding may cause things to happen, may cause some state to change. But I still wouldn’t consider the declarative data binding itself to have side effects.

                  The components are coupled to the structure of the data, not the graphql query. Where would you rather make the http requests? Somewhere in the redux layer? That's basically what Apollo client does anyways, it just reduces boilerplate.<p>Although I think coupling components with data structures is the smaller benefit. The real benefit of graphQL is not the client architecture, the real benefit is decoupling frontends from backends, unifying disjointed backends, and efficiency.</p><p>In the name of efficiency though, graph QL is projecting a graph into a tree which involves denormalizing & duplicating data in the response.

                  &gt;launch a modern web app<p>It took me a long time to realize that "launching the app" is not really what these tools are for. You can create perfectly fine awesome web apps with just HTML/CSS/ES5.</p><p>But as it gets more complex, or you add collaborators, or you feel how much easier/faster certain things would be if you could operate at a different level of abstraction... the world does tend to pull you towards these tools. None of them are necessary though, they just trade a little ramp at the beginning for a lot of saved headaches later on. I still don't use have of this stuff, but I recall recently debugging an issue that was a couple of clicks into an SPA (in an interview no less) and I sure wished I had jumped through the hoops to get hot module reloading on that one! Likewise, I'm kind of ready for tests now, to make sure the rendered HTML is what I expect in various scenarios, rather than walk through the app like a paranoid moron after every change.</p><p>I think the way to stay sane in modern front-end development is to not overthink the tools - if your project is already using them, great, use them the right amount for your team. If you don't use, say, Redux, but your state management is causing lots of pain, hey, maybe it's time for Redux now. If you already write only beautiful ES5 that runs correctly an is easy to reason about, who needs Babel.</p><p>My favorite situation is when somebody else picked the tools and the build process and I don't have to give a crap about evaluating all the options. Knowing and caring about all of the pros and cons IS a lot of bandwidth!

                  Definitely a lot of stuff going on.  I take that as a sign of maturity rather than a problem.  It's not really any different from C++ or Java or Python.

                  You are partially right but you have to remember that each of these is addressing a generally large pain point. So by embracing a standard solution, you can abstract that point away to some degree. This tradeoff is called progress.

                  I find you need different tools for different jobs.<p>I personally build 80% of my apps using Rails or Django, with vanilla coffeescript or javascript + a few libraries for graphs. That works for most business applications, and pretty much any information app (which IMO are usually the most valuable by dollars)</p><p>Rails is easier for most people to develop in (even if they are framiliar with JS or Django) within a week of starting. Usually after a 5 minute discussion I can show them why it's amazing and everyone switches over.</p><p>However, at a point, react and the like becomes easier when you want a prettier customer facing application, or when you want only part of the web page to update in real time (Personally, I can do this in Rails, but many find react easier). Point being, in those cases a framework that's literally built for that might be easier, and that's when it should be used.</p><p>Honestly, I think this whole JS craze is annoying, and I try to run no javascript. Because of that, I might be more sensitive than most and I design websites accordingly (only using JS as necessary)

                  I went down the path of learning Relay instead of Apollo. I'm regretting this decision. Relay is too restrictive, and the relay compiler is far too sensitive for most server side endpoints.

                  What put the nail in the coffin to Relay for me was watching a talk by the dev team where they said they don't want to create proper documentation because they feel like that's creating a contract with the community to support the API.

                  Interesting. I've worked with Relay almost since its release, more recently on the modern branch, and haven't run into anything that's been too restrictive. You have an element of thinking about things in "Relay" terms (in the sense of how to structure them) but once you've figured that it then things just work (TM).<p>I'm curious about the second part of your statement, the compiler being too sensitive for your server side endpoints,  can you elaborate on that a bit?

                  Sure. The first issue I came across was that the relay compiler expects a strict specification when mutating data, one that wasn't compatible with the server library I was using. Expect to write your own server side scaffolder to get around this.<p>The second big issue was that relay modern decoupled the networking logic, so having a series of chained queries is something you either have to handle yourself or write your own networking logic for. And because creating dynamic queries can't be done with relay it's a bit annoying that this logic isn't handled automatically for you.</p><p>My biggest gripe happens to be the lack of flexibility around dynamic queries. You can't define the data you want back at run time, which feels defeats a major point of GraphQL.</p><p>Apollo supports dynamic queries with higher-order components. It might be a case of the grass looks greener on the other side, but I felt as soon as you try to do something bigger than a todo app with Relay you start to feel the restrictions.

                  I've been working with a React+GraphQL+Apollo+PostgraphQL stack as of late it and has been absolute joy. Apollo is super robust and has excellent documentation and PostgraphQL _just worked_ out of the box against an existing Postgres database.

                  The weird flicker/initial empty page (might) be because all the components are being mounted synchronously on page load. The new version of react introduced async rendering of new components: <a href="https://medium.com/behind-the-screens/dont-load-all-your-web-components-at-once-19580acd86f3" target="_blank">https://medium.com/behind-the-screens/dont-load-all-your-web...</a>

                  Are you sure it is not due to the fetching of content form the server rather than the UI synchronicity? I'm quite certain it is just latency for the download. The components might be fetching that data during their mounting if the architecture was set up that way, but the actual mounting shouldn't be the cause; React's UI is much faster than latency caused by that alone.<p>It would be better if the components showed a waiting indicator during the download, if the components are responsible for the download. Alternately, the page itself could show that loader before mounting its sub components. Actually, there are many "alternately"s because frankly this site's approach isn't ideal.

                  Yes the benefit is that you can prefetch other page assets then client render new pages using only GraphQL queries. Download the whole site once and and runs more like an app afterwards.<p>Perhaps a good alternative to the flicker effect would be to put loading indicators in place of each UI component as it loads so you can see the structure.

                  This new site is around 1MB, regular HN is around 50KB. They're not even close. It's just that navigating to new pages is faster since it doesn't take a full page refresh.

                  They've implemented this as a SPA so all the pages are downloading at once not just the home page. Probably could be optimized with some lazy loading. Still, vanilla HN obviously  has no framework so no need to download React/Apollo, etc. I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume that they're using this as a learning tool and a teaching tool. Just like no one needs a framework to implement a TO DO list, but that's the go to example app.

                  That would be the case when the bandwidth was the limit, but it’s not.<p>The limit is in the immense latency for opening a new connection.</p><p>Opening a network socket with TLS can take over 4 seconds on mobile, which is why ideally you’d even use an open websocket for communication instead of new GET requests. Navigating to a page in this version causes one or two network requests, in the real HN it takes far more just to check if the images have changed, the CSS has changed, etc.

                  Using websocket looks like overengineering because HTTP/2.0 allows to use a single connection for multiple parallel requests.<p>Using React to build a simple (student level) site like HN is overengineering too in my opinion. If you don't want to reload the page when navigating you can just reload HTML content with jQuery or fetch() without using client side rendering, without draining device battery and without loading 1 Mb of Javascript that will take much more space in RAM.</p><p>SPA approach should be used for interactive applications able to work in offline mode, able to provide rich experience on mobile devices etc.

                  On a slow laptop on a reasonably fast connection (university WLAN) using FF 57 Beta the clone is slower. It is slightly faster than real HN at showing the orange bar and the tan content box (which I find quite jarring), the text then pops in noticeably later. Some pages also appear to first show error pages that then get replaced with content. (This even happens on repeat visits to a page, where this seems to cheat and take the comments from cache instead of checking for new ones)<p>Not sure how to explain that difference.

                  While I don't want to belittle this accomplishment. The magic of Hacker News is the community that is on it. As a piece of technology NH isn't all that impressive.<p>This kind of feels a little over-engineered.</p><p>Edit: To downvoters, care to explain why I am wrong?</p><p>The project is extremely well done. It is impressive in its documentation and execution. But in the real world done, launched, and with traction is more important than being well engineered. The existing implementations of upvote style sites work just fine.</p><p>When Digg.com -- one of the first upvote style boards to go mainstream -- launched in 2004 dozens of copy cats came up. Few succeeded. Why? Community.</p><p>Also, we are moving away from the decentralized web, unfortunately. For instance, few people run their own Wordpress blog now. Most use Blogger or Medium. I don't see how projects like this fit in in that world.</p><p>Now, if rather than be a HN clone he added the ability for people to create and moderate their own boards. That would get my upvote.
