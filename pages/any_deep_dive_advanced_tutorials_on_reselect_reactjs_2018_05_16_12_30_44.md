Reselect's implementation looks <em>very</em> roughly like this:</p><pre><code>function createSelector(inputSelectors, finalSelector) {

    return function selectorFunction(...args) {
        const inputResults = inputSelectors.map(selector =&gt; selector(...args));
        
        return finalSelector(...inputResults);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Note that whatever arguments you passed to the selector actually get passed to all of the input selectors you used in creating it.  So, those input selectors <em>can</em> absolutely use more than one argument, not just <code>state</code>, but the inputs also need to be somewhat compatible with each other.  If, say, <code>inputSelector1</code> is expecting its second argument to be an object with <code>{itemId}</code>, and <code>inputSelector2</code> is expecting its second argument to be a number, then things would probably break.</p><p>As for factory functions, the issue is that a given selector generated by <code>createSelector</code> by default only memoizes the arguments it was last called with.  If you're only calling it with <code>const someData = selectTheData(getState())</code>, then there's no problem.  However, if you have a component that wants to look up an item based on an ID it was given as a prop, and multiple instances of that component exist at once, then each component would be using the same instance of the selector function, like this: <code>const itemData = selectTheItem(state, ownProps.itemId)</code>.  That means that the memoization for the selector would be useless, because every component would be passing in different arguments.</p><p>Using the factory syntax for a Redux <code>mapState</code> function gives you space to create a unique selector function instance for every component.  That allows the memoization to work properly for that component instance, since the inputs to the selector will be consistent between calls.  A basic example looks like:</p><pre><code>function makeMapState(originalState, originalOwnProps) {
    const uniqueSelectorInstance = makeSelectorForThisItem();
    
    return function actualMapState(state, ownProps) {
        const dataForThisItem = uniqueSelectorInstance(state, ownProps.itemId);
        
        return {item : dataForThisItem};
    }    
}
