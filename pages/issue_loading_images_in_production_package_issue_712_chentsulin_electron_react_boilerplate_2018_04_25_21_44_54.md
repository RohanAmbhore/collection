<p>I realise this issue has been referenced before, but I have tried the suggested solutions from <a href="https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/250#issuecomment-227494838" target="_blank">#250</a> and am still unable to load images when I package my app.</p>
<p>I am accessing images in development two ways - both in CSS as follows:</p>
<p><code>background: url('../assets/image_to_load.png')</code></p>
<p>and in my .js files like this:</p>
<pre><code>var Logo = require('../assets/48x48.png');
&lt;img src={Logo} /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Both load fine on the dev server, but not in the production package. I tried <code>alert(Logo)</code> in dev and in production, and got<br />
<code>data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoA....</code> from the dev environment and<br />
<code>data:image/png;base64,bW9kdWxlLmV4....</code> in the prod package.</p>
<p>I have also tried using <code>import Logo from '../assets/48x48.png'</code>, and the production app errors out when it fails to find the images.</p>
<p>I am currently using <code>url-loader</code> in the webpack config for images. Any advice on how to proceed would be much appreciated. Thanks.</p>
