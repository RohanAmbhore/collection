As we can see, parse time (shown in orange) is a significant portion of where many of these sites spend their time:</p></div><div><figure id="0bee"><div><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*9BMRW5i_bS4By_JSESXX8A.png?q=20" /><div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img /></div></figure><div><p id="b3ba"><a href="https://wego.com" target="_blank">Wego</a>, a site that uses PRPL, manages to maintain a low parse time for their routes, getting interactive very quickly. Many of the other sites above adopted code-splitting and performance budgets to try lowering their JS costs.</p><h4 id="3382">Other costs</h4><p id="a590">JavaScript can impact page performance in other ways:</p><ul><li id="2cf4">Memory. Pages can appear to jank or pause frequently due to GC (garbage collection). When a browser reclaims memory, JS execution is paused so a browser frequently collecting garbage can pause execution more frequently than we may like. Avoid memory leaks and frequent gc pauses to keep pages jank free.</li><li id="d3aa">During runtime, long-running JavaScript can block the main-thread causing pages that are unresponsive. Chunking up work into smaller pieces (using requestAnimationFrame() or requestIdleCallback() for scheduling) can minimize responsiveness issues.</li></ul><p id="c8cf"><strong>Progressive Bootstrapping</strong></p><p id="0e91">Many sites optimize content visibility as the expensive of interactivity. To get a fast first paint when you do have large JavaScript bundles, developers sometimes employ server-side rendering; then “upgrade” it to attach event handlers when the JavaScript finally gets fetched.</p><p id="7fc2">Be careful — this has its own costs. You 1) generally send down a <em>larger</em> HTML response which can push our interactivity, 2) can leave the user in an uncanny valley where half the experience can’t actually be interactive until JavaScript finishes processing.</p><p id="7d18">Progressive Bootstrapping may be a better approach. Send down a minimally functional page (composed of just the HTML/JS/CSS needed for the current route). As more resources arrive, the app can lazy-load and unlock more features.</p></div><div><figure id="7abc"><div><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*zY03Y5nVEY21FXA63Qe8PA.png?q=20" /><div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img /></div><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/aerotwist/status/729712502943174657" target="_blank">Progressive Bootstrapping</a> visual by Paul Lewis</figcaption></figure><div><p id="2202"><strong>Loading code proportionate to what’s in view is the holy grail.
