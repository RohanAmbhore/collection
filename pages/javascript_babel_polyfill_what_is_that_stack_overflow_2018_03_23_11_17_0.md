<p>I just started to use Babel to compile my ES6 javascript code into ES5. When I start to use Promises it looks like it's not working. The Babel website states support for promises via polyfills.</p>

<p>Without any luck, I tried to add:</p>

<pre><code>require("babel/polyfill");</code></pre>



<pre><code>import * as p from "babel/polyfill";</code></pre>

<p>With that I'll get the following error on my app bootstrapping:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cannot find module 'babel/polyfill'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I searched for the module but it seems I'm missing some fundamental thing here. I also tried to add the old and good bluebird NPM but it looks like it's not working.</p>

<p>How to use the polyfills from Babel?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/" target="_blank">Babel docs</a> describe this pretty concisely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Babel includes a polyfill that includes a custom regenerator runtime
  and core.js.</p>
  
  <p>This will emulate a full ES6 environment. This polyfill is
  automatically loaded when using babel-node and babel/register.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure you require it at the entry-point to your application, before anything else is called. If you're using a tool like webpack, that becomes pretty simple (you can tell webpack to include it in the bundle).</p>

<p>If you're using a tool like <code>gulp-babel</code> or <code>babel-loader</code>, you need to also install the <code>babel</code> package itself to use the polyfill.</p>

<p>Also note that for modules that affect the global scope (polyfills and the like), you can use a terse import to avoid having unused variables in your module:</p>

<pre><code>import 'babel/polyfill';</code></pre>
    </div>
    
</div>
    
        </div>

<p>First off, the obvious answer that no one has provided, you need to install Babel into your application:</p>

<pre><code>npm install babel --save</code></pre>

<p>(or <code>babel-core</code> if you instead want to <code>require('babel-core/polyfill')</code>).</p>

<p>Aside from that, I have a grunt task to transpile my es6 and jsx as a build step (i.e. I don't want to use <code>babel/register</code>, which is why I am trying to use <code>babel/polyfill</code> directly in the first place), so I'd like to put more emphasis on this part of @ssube's answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make sure you require it at the entry-point to your application,
  before anything else is called</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I ran into some weird issue where I was trying to require <code>babel/polyfill</code> from some shared environment startup file and I got the error the user referenced - I think it might have had something to do with how babel orders imports versus requires but I'm unable to reproduce now. Anyway, moving <code>import 'babel/polyfill'</code> as the first line in both my client and server startup scripts fixed the problem.</p>

<p>Note that if you instead want to use <code>require('babel/polyfill')</code> I would make sure all your other module loader statements are also requires and not use imports - avoid mixing the two. In other words, if you have any import statements in your startup script, make <code>import babel/polyfill</code> the first line in your script rather than <code>require('babel/polyfill')</code>.</p>

<p>This changed a bit in babel v6.</p>

<p>From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The polyfill will emulate a full ES6 environment. This polyfill is automatically loaded when using babel-node.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Installation:</strong><br />
<code>$ npm install babel-polyfill</code></p>

<p><strong>Usage in Node / Browserify / Webpack:</strong><br />
To include the polyfill you need to require it at the top of the entry point to your application.<br />
<code>require("babel-polyfill");</code></p>

<p><strong>Usage in Browser:</strong><br />
Available from the <code>dist/polyfill.js</code> file within a <code>babel-polyfill</code> npm release. This needs to be included before all your compiled Babel code. You can either prepend it to your compiled code or include it in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> before it.</p>

<p>NOTE: Do not <code>require</code> this via browserify etc, use <code>babel-polyfill</code>.</p>

    <div>
<p>If your package.json looks something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>  ...
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel": "^6.5.2",
    "babel-eslint": "^6.0.4",
    "babel-polyfill": "^6.8.0",
    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.6.0",
    "babelify": "^7.3.0",
  ...</code></pre>

<p>And you get the <code>Cannot find module 'babel/polyfill'</code> error message, then you probably just need to change your import statement FROM:</p>

<pre><code>import "babel/polyfill";</code></pre>



<pre><code>import "babel-polyfill";</code></pre>

<p>And make sure it comes before any other <code>import</code> statement (not necessarily at the entry point of your application).</p>

  <p>babel-polyfill allows you to use the full set of ES6 features beyond
  syntax changes. This includes features such as new built-in objects
  like Promises and WeakMap, as well as new static methods like
  Array.from or Object.assign.</p>
  
  <p>Without babel-polyfill, babel only allows you to use features like
  arrow functions, destructuring, default arguments, and other
  syntax-specific features introduced in ES6.</p>
