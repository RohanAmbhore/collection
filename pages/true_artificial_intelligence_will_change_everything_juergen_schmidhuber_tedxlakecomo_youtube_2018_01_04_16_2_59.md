Scientific Director of the Swiss AI Lab, IDSIA, DTI, SUPSI; Prof. of AI, Faculty of Informatics, USI, Lugano; Co-founder & Chief Scientist, NNAISENSE, Switzerland. Prof. Jürgen Schmidhuber has been called the father of modern Artificial Intelligence. His lab's deep learning methods have revolutionized machine learning and are now available on 3 billion smartphones, and used billions of times per day, e.g. for Facebook's automatic translation, Google's speech recognition, Apple's Siri & QuickType, Amazon's Alexa, etc. His research group also established the field of mathematically rigorous universal AI and optimal universal problem solvers. His formal theory of creativity & curiosity & fun explains art, science, music, and humor. He is recipient of numerous awards including the 2016 IEEE Neural Networks Pioneer Award "for pioneering contributions to deep learning and neural networks".
