This is essentially a self-help guide for programmers, the kind of book that enumerates the habits of Good and Happy People and makes you feel slightly guilty about not practicing most of them, but probably won't result in you forsaking your evil ways and stepping on the path toward Nirvana. Hunt and Thomas are friendly but occasionally annoying gurus. Their cloying metaphors (boiled frogs, etc) and kitsch jokes are offputting, and some of their advice borders on insult. One assumes that when th

I no longer have any need for mentors or friends now that I have AVClub (the AVQ&A and "Gateways to Geekery" columns in particular), Quora, and Stack Overflow.<br /><br />Case in point: That I found this book. Over the past couple of years I have been gradually writing and less-gradually maintaining a code base for separate projects. It's getting the point where I might as well figure out what the hell I'm doing. So I go to Stack Overflow and find my way to a question like "What programming book do you

While many complain about already knowing everything in the book, or that it's outdated, I believe they are quite missing the point. Perhaps this book didn't speak to you at the point you are at in developing your skills and crafts, but it might speak to someone else just beginning. Rating the book low for the reason it wasn't what you needed is rather disingenuous, as a rating should be a guide to the quality of the book overall. <br /><br />The information contained in this book is essential for software

(4.0) Good for new programmers<br /><br />This seems to be a favorite in the office, so before I participating in the recommending of this book to new hires, I figured I should check it out first. There is definitely some good stuff in here, but most won't be new for anyone who's been programming professionally for 2 or 3 years or more. I think most engineers' problems is that they don't do what they know is the right thing.<br /><br />I think many people have said this before, but at the risk of duplication I'll say t

This is my favorite non-technical tech book. It explores good software development practices. In my opinion it is more than just a checklist of what you should do - it literally changed my approach to development with positive results.<br /><br />Others have mentionned that they already knew most of the things in this book, and practice these good habits in their development environments.

Причём лучше прочитать уже на втором-третьем курсе, чтобы студенты не только знали языки программирования и алгоритмы, но и принципы разработки, чтобы они понимали, что значит «быть разработчиком».<br /><br />Книга состоит из небольших глав, сгруппированных в разделы, читается легко, авторы не «лезут в дебри», да и в целом книга небольшая, так что с учётом этих причн, я, опять же, в первую очередь реком

For a total beginner, the concepts will be difficult to internalize. For a seasoned programmer (on a good team...), it will be little more than a general reinforcement. While it's hard to imagine the right time in one's career to read the <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i> (probably, often), it's a classic. It's written at a high enough level that very little material is outdated- in fact some of the arguments ring much truer now than they would have in 1999.

Who is this book for?<br /><br />Certainly not for experienced, skilled software developers. Considering myself at least experienced, I found most of the material in this book a rehash of methodologies and techniques I've used for more than a decade. Granted, there were a few gems here and there, but mostly I was bored because I didn't learn anything new.<br /><br />One has to respect that this book is from 1999, so in that perspective, it must have been quite ground-breaking.

The beautiful thing about a book like <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i> is that it sparks ideas when you read it. Can you do something more efficiently? Can you do it more elegantly? Can you make the computer do the work instead?<br /><br />I like to think that I already ask myself those questions all the time. Nevertheless, I found myself reading a page or two and then having to stop because I was having a great idea and needed to write it down. I filled six sheets of letter-size paper with dense, cryptic notes. Th

I don't think I can gush enough about this book. <br /><br />It's the kind of thing I unconsciously resist reading because I know of all the guilty feelings it could provoke. Well, one thing I can tell you is that it's not like that at all. Oh actually, yes it is. The first chapter starts off gently reminding you that you should be constantly learning new things, for example, a new programming language every year (not necessarily because you want to have mastery of that language, but because it's good to ke

The Pragmatic Programmer is centered on good programming practices. It is very well written and is able to persuade you to want to change your habits and behavior. I intend on re-reading this book on a regular basis (anually, perhaps) because there is certainly a learning and adaptation curve to all the techniques that are introduced. Although I do use some of them on my day-to-day work, it's very difficult to start using every single tip at once, so I'll introduce them gradually on my working f

This is probably my favorite book about technology. Full of great and timeless advice for anyone working on the field; written by one of my biggest inspirations in programming, master Dave Thomas.<br /><br />It's more philosophical than technical which makes it a nice and easy read.<br /><br />The book is not written in linear way so whenever you need inspiration, you can just open it in a random page and get charged up. Reason why I have a hard copy with me.<br /><br />I've read it twice already and I will probably read it again.

A great non technical book that goes into codifying the good practices about software development. It is a must read for neophytes in software industry with a couple of years of experience. <br />If you have worked or are working in a good team and good project, you can easily relate back and forth about the goof things that are talked about.<br /><br />It is simple to read, still relevant in 2016 and is worth investing couple of weeks to read this if you are aspiring to be a pragmatic programmer.

Not great. This book aged really weirdly and it explains itself when you realize theres a bullet pointed list in the back that they probably just created fluff around.<br /><br />There are a whole bunch of stand out weird suggestions the book has, but I think my major problem with it is that it rambles back and forth into light level technical things and sort of wastes time there.

This book is a real kick-in-the-pants for computer programmers. No matter where you are on the technology curve, this book will give you great insight into developing your craft.<br /><br />The premise of the book is that software development is a craft. The subtitle of the book is, "From journeyman to master", which evokes the traditional pathway a person learned to ply a craft. An apprentice would sit at the feet of a master and learn the secrets of the trade.<br /><br />Computer programming, though, is often a solit

I used to teach a course from this book. Well, not entirely from this book, but mostly from it. Despite it not being designed as a textbook, it's eminently suitable as one. I often think, looking back at this experience, that textbooks should *really* be written in lecture-size chunks, not in huge chapters like most are. The book provides somewhat of a "tour de force" through sane programming practices. It slightly predates the eXtreme Programming craze, but elements of agile development are cle

If you're going to be a solid, productive programmer, what are the ground rules? What are the basic "do"s and "don't"s?<br /><br />They're all here.<br /><br />Basic stuff like:<br /><br />Don't Repeat Yourself, which states that, if you find the some piece of code in more than one place, refactor it so the duplicated code is in a function, procedure or template. If you have to modify the code, either for adding functionality or for fixing a bug, you will have only one place where you need to edit it. Otherwise, if there are mul

First of all I want to say that Russian translation is terrible, I strongly advise every russian speaker who thought about reading the translation - to read the original.<br /><br />The book itself is obviously somewhat outdated but in general really great set of techniques and approaches that will allow you to become a better software engineer.<br /><br />The techniques described here partially became a foundation for agile software development methodologies, as I see it. <br /><br />One other great thing about this book is that

This book makes me both excited to become a software engineer and to learn all of the things in order to become a good one (which, it turns out, is a lot). It's the perfect combination of high-level tips and low-level recommendations (which I assume are now out of print, but should point me toward newer alternatives), and its style is fantastic. The authors present their advice in a rational way which made it attractive for me to try and assimilate the advice into my work without becoming overwh

The authors propose their philosophy of software development, some of which can be applied to life in general. So the DRY principle- Don't Repeat Yourself says that if any information exists in more than one place, then inevitably, when it is updated, it won't be updated everywhere it is found. <br /><br />So the key is to make sure that all information exists in just one location, and that anything that needs the information obtains it from that location, so that updates are propagated automatically.
