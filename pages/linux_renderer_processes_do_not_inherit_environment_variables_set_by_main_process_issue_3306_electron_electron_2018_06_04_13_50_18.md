          <p>One used to be able to do this from the main process:</p>
<div><pre>process.env['HELLO'] = 'WORLD';</pre></div>
<p>And the <code>HELLO</code> environment variable would exist in every renderer spawned after the fact.</p>
<p>I was able to narrow down when the issue started to appear: <code>0.28.3</code> seems to have changed that behaviour for the Linux releases. Before that, environment inheriting worked.</p>

          <p>This is unfortunately expected behavior on Linux, because Chromium uses a zygote process to fork renderer processes instead of forking them directly in parent process.</p>
<p>I tried to fix this by disabling zygote process (<a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/1323" target="_blank">#1323</a>), but it then produced more problems like <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1605" target="_blank">#1605</a>, so I have to bring it back (<a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/2014" target="_blank">#2014</a>).</p>
<p>To work around it you can probably read the env from <code>remote.process.env</code>.</p>
