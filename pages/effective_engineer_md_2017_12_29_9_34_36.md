<h3>What's an Effective Engineer?</h3>
<ul>
<li>They are the people who get things done. Effective Engineers produce results.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adopt the Right Mindsets</h2>
<h3>Focus on High Leverage Activities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Invested</li>
<li>Use Leverage as Your Yardstick for Effectiveness</li>
<li>80% of the impact comes from 20% of the work.</li>
<li>Focus on high leverage and not just easy wins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optimize for Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change jobs if you have to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimizing for learning is high leverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt a growth mindset.</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk to people. Become good at telling stories. It gets better with time.</li>
<li>Those with a growth mindset believe that they can cultivate and grow their intelligence and skills through effort.</li>
<li>Own your story.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invest in the rate of learning</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning compunds. Compounding leads to exponential growth. Earlier the compounding starts, the better.</li>
<li>Working on unchallenging tasks is a huge opportunity cost. You missed out on compounded learning.</li>
<li>Prioritize learning over profitability.</li>
<li>Invest your time in activities with the highest learning rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek Work Environments Conducive to Learning</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast Growth: Companies where #problems &gt;&gt; #resources. Opportunity to choose high impact work.</li>
<li>Make sure you are working on high priority projects.</li>
<li>Openness: Look for culture with curiosity, where everyone is encouraged to ask questions.</li>
<li>Fast Paced.</li>
<li>People smarter than you.</li>
<li>Autonomy: Freedom to choose what to work on. Smaller comanies =&gt; More autonomy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>While on Job</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a daily habit of acquiring new skills.</li>
<li>Read code written by brilliant engineers.</li>
<li>Jump fearlessly into code you don't know.</li>
<li>Always be learning. Invest in skills that are in high demand.</li>
<li>Read Books. Attend Conferences.</li>
<li>Build and maintain strong relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prioritize Regularly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Opportunity cost of working on wrong ideas can set back growth by years.</li>
<li>Prioritize tasks based on ROI</li>
<li>Regular prioritization is high leverage activity.</li>
<li>On TODO Lists
<ul>
<li>Maintain a 'single' todo lists where all tasks are listed.</li>
<li>Don't try to remember stuff. Brain is bad at remembering. It's rather good at processing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask yourself regularly: Is this the most important thing I should be working on ?</li>
<li>Focus on what directly produces value.</li>
<li>Learn to say no.</li>
<li>Focus on the important and non-urgent.</li>
<li>Find ways to get into flow. ‚ÄúA state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems.‚Äù</li>
<li>When possible, preserve larger blocks of focused time in your schedule.</li>
<li>Limit the amount of Work in Progress.
<ul>
<li>Cost of context switching is high.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prioritizing is difficult.</li>
<li>Prioritization is high leverage. It has huge impact on your ability to get right things done.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Invest in Iteration Speed</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continuous Deployment is high leverage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will save a lot of time in manual deployment of code.They are the people who get things done. Effective Engineers produce results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move Fast to Learn Fast</p>
<ul>
<li>Move fast and break things.</li>
<li>Moving fast enables us to build more things and learn at faster rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invest in time saving tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have to do something more than twwise, write a tool the third time.</li>
<li>Tools are multipliers that allow your to scale your impact beyond the confines of a day.</li>
<li>Faster tools get used more often.</li>
<li>Faster tools can enable new workflows that previously weren't possible.</li>
<li>Productivity skyrockets with tools.</li>
<li>Time saving property of tools also scale with team adoption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shorten your debugging and Validation Loops</p>
<ul>
<li>Extra time spent in optimizing debugging workflow can help you fix annoying bugs with less headache.</li>
<li>Debugging is hard. It's time conuming. Upfront investments to shorten debugging loops are worth it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>High test coverage to reduce build and site breakages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast unit tests to encourage people to run them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast and incremental compiles and reloads to reduce development time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master you Programming Environment</p>
<ul>
<li>One editor. One high level language. Shell. Keyboard &gt; Mouse. Automate manual workflows. Use interactive shell. Make running specific tests easy.
** Faster you can iterate, faster you can learn.**</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Measure what you want to Improve</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use metric to drive progress
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good metric.</p>
<ul>
<li>Helps you focus on right things.</li>
<li>Drives forward progress.</li>
<li>Helps you guard against future regressions.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Ratcheting</strong>: Any change should strictly improve the metric.</li>
<li>Bad metric can lead to unwanted behavior.</li>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li>#hours worked &lt; Productivity</li>
<li>click through rates &lt; long click through rates</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Metric you choose influences your decisions and behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for metric that, when optimized, maximizes impact for the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actionable metric - Whose movement can be causally explained by team's effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsive metric - Updates quickly to give back feedback whether a given change was =ve or -ive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choosing a metric is high leverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dedicate time to pick right metric.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instrument everythong to understand what's going on.
<ul>
<li>Measure anything, measure everything.</li>
<li>Graphite, statsd. A single line of code lets you define a new counter or timer on the fly.</li>
<li>Measuring goals you want to achieve is high leverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internalize useful numbers
<ul>
<li>Knowledge of useful numbers provide a valuable shortcut for knowing where to invest efforts to maximize gains.</li>
<li>Need upfront work. Need not be accurate, ballpark idea suffices.</li>
<li>Knowing useful numbers enables you to do back of the envelope calculations to quickly estimate the perrmance properties of a design without actually building it.</li>
<li>Internalizing useful number help you spot anamalies.
Be skeptical about data integrity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>log data liberally.</li>
<li>Build tools to iterate on data accuracy sooner.</li>
<li>Examine data sooner.</li>
<li>When numbers look off, dig in to it sooner.</li>
</ul>
<p><g-emoji>‚úîÔ∏è</g-emoji> Measure your progress. Carefully choose your top-level metric. Instrument your system. Know your numbers. Prioritize data integrity.</p>
<h3>Validate your ideas early and often.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not validating early leads to wasted efforts.</li>
<li>Dont delay get feedback.</li>
<li>Find low effort ways to validate work.</li>
<li>Power of small batches. Helps you avoid making a big mistake by stopping the flow.</li>
<li>Approach problem iteratively.</li>
<li>No large implementations.</li>
<li>Working solo? Be wary. Be extra vocal and get feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improve project estimation skills.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beware of mythical man month. Communication overhead is significant.</li>
<li>Reduce risk early</li>
<li>Rewrite projects - almost always fail.</li>
<li>Additional hours hurt prooductivity. Causes burnout.</li>
<li>Do the riskiest task first.</li>
<li>Allow buffer room for the unknown.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Balance Quality with Pragmatism</h3>
<ul>
<li>High codequality. Code readability.</li>
<li>Establish sustainable code review process.</li>
<li>Code reviews help:
<ul>
<li>Catch bugs and design problems early.</li>
<li>Sharing working knowledge of the codebase.</li>
<li>Increases long term agility. Easier to unerstand, quicker to modify.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Manage complexity through Abstraction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Example: MapReduce</li>
<li>Right abstractions make huge difference.</li>
<li>‚ÄúPick the right ones, and programming will flow naturally from design; modules will have small and simple interfaces; and new functionality will more likely fit in without extensive reorganization,‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúPick the wrong ones, and programming will be a series of nasty surprises: interfaces will become baroque and clumsy as they are forced to accommodate unanticipated interactions, and even the simplest of changes will be hard to make.‚Äù</li>
<li>The right abstraction can increase engineering productivity by an order of magnitude.</li>
<li>Simple abstractions avoid interweaving multiple concepts, so that you can reason about them independently rather than being forced to consider them together.</li>
<li>Designing good abstractions take work.</li>
<li>An abstraction's usage and popularity provides a reasonable proxy for it's quality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Automate Testing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unit test cases and some integration testing provide a scalable way of managing growing codebase.</li>
<li>A suite of extensive and automated tests can reduce overall error rates by validating the quality and by safeguardingagainst regressions.</li>
<li>Tests also allow engineers to make changes, especially large refactorings, with significantly higher confidence.</li>
<li>Despite its benefits, it can be difficult to foster a culture of automated testing.</li>
<li>Focus on high leverage tests.</li>
<li>Writing more tests, creating a virtuous feedback cycle and saving more development time.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Repay Techincal Debt</h4>
<ul>
<li>Technical debt refers to all the deferred work that‚Äôs necessary to improve the health and quality of the codebase and that would slow us down if left unaddressed.</li>
<li>Accumulating technical debt is fine as far as it is repaid within time.</li>
<li>Refactor often.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reduce Operational Complexity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep no. of technologies low. Don‚Äôt sway towards shiny new technologies.</li>
<li>Every additional technology you add is is guaranteed to go worong eventually. Will need your time.</li>
<li>Do the simple thing first</li>
<li>Embrace operational simplicity.</li>
<li>The first solution that comes to mind is generally complex. Don't stop. Keep peeling off the layers of onion.</li>
<li>Simplify the architecture to reduce their operational burden.</li>
<li>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the simplest solution that can get the job done while also reducing our future operational burden?‚Äù</li>
<li>Discipline to focus on simplicity is high leverage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fail Fast</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fail immediately and visibly.</li>
<li>doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean crashing your programs for users</li>
<li>fail-fast to surface issues immediately</li>
<li>Failing fast is high leverage as it saves devugging time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relentlessly Automate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Automating mechanics is good.</li>
<li>Automating decision making - no.</li>
<li>Hone Your Ability to Respond and Recover Quickly
<ul>
<li>Leverage ( Recovering quickly ) &gt; Leverage ( Preventing Failures )</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>‚Äúscript for success,‚Äù practice failure scenarios, and work on our ability to recover quickly.</li>
<li>Make batch process idempotent</li>
<li>Make processes retrable i.e. not leaving any global state.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Invest in your team's Growth</h3>
<ul>
<li>Invest in onboarding.</li>
<li>The higher you climb up the engineering ladder, the more your effectiveness will be measured not by your individual contributions but by your impact on the people around you.</li>
<li><strong>"You‚Äôre a staff engineer if you‚Äôre making a whole team better than it would be otherwise. You‚Äôre a principal engineer if you‚Äôre making the whole company better than it would be otherwise. And you‚Äôre distinguished if you‚Äôre improving the industry.‚Äù</strong>
Ôøº- Focus primarily on making everyone around you succeed.</li>
<li>Your career depends on your team's success.</li>
<li>Make hiring everyone's responsibility.</li>
<li>Shared ownership of code.
<ul>
<li>Keep bus factor more than one.</li>
<li>Shared ownershop removes isolated silos of information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build collective wisdom through post mortems.</li>
<li>Invest in automated testing.
<ul>
<li>Automated testcases lead to higher confidence when refactoring.</li>
<li>Write test cases when the code is fresh in mind.</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt be dogmatic about 100% code coverage.</li>
<li>Value of tests increases over time and cost to write goes down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire the best.</li>
<li>Surround yourself with great advisors</li>
</ul>
