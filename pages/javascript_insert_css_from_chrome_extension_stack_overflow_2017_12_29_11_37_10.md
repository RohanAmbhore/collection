<p>I'm working on a chrome extension that allows the user to change the CSS of a page. I've attempted using the insertCSS method in the chrome.tabs api, and simply trying to append a style tag to the HTML, but i have not been successful. Can anyone tell me how either the insertCSS method works, or how to reach the web page from a .js file in the extension?</p>
