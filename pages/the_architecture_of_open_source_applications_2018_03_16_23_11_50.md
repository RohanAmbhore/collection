            Architects look at thousands of buildings during their
            training, and study critiques of those buildings written
            by masters.  In contrast, most software developers only
            ever get to know a handful of large programs
            well—usually programs they wrote
            themselves—and never study the great programs of
            history.  As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes
            rather than building on one another's successes.

            Our goal is to change that.  In these two books, the authors of
            four dozen open source applications explain how their software
            is structured, and why.  What are each program's major
            components?  How do they interact?  And what did their builders
            learn during their development?  In answering these questions,
            the contributors to these books provide unique insights into how
            they think.

            If you are a junior developer, and want to learn how your
            more experienced colleagues think, these books are the place
            to start.  If you are an intermediate or senior developer,
            and want to see how your peers have solved hard design
            problems, these books can help you too.
