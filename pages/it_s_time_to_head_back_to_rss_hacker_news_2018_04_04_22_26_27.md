                  The key thing to know about RSS is that most of the real news sources, those that have actual reporters who go out and find news, have RSS feeds. Reuters, the Associated Press, the New York Times, the BBC...<p>Here's Reuters Top News.[1] Just the news, no ads, no clickbait.  Reuters is useful because their RSS feed contains a readable story summary. Many RSS feeds just have a truncated sentence and a link. Both CNN [2] and Fox News [3] are like that. Voice of America is at the other extreme - the whole story is on RSS.[4]</p><p>[1] <a href="http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/topNews" target="_blank">http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/topNews</a>

                  Ah, tt-rss... After Google announced that Google Reader was going the way of the dodo, I spun up my own instance of tt-rss, and used their (paid) Android app too... until I decided to file some bugs on their Redmine bug tracker.<p>There were a few bugs I had encountered (can't recall if it was on the mobile app, or on the browser UI), and decided to report to them. I opened a few reports (maybe 2 or 3?), and continued on my merry way. Checked in a not long after, and discovered that the developer didn't bother to <i>really</i> read my bug reports, and instead, berated me (if my fuzzy recollection is to be believed, something to the effect of "I don't know what you're talking about" and "you're stupid go away"), followed by closing the bug reports. No effort on his side to try to understand, no further digging for more information if something was unclear.</p><p>Being a software developer myself, I'd like to think I'm generally familiar with reporting reasonably useful bugs (repro steps, observed behavior, expected behavior, etc.), and even if I didn't include all information, I'm more than happy to provide more as requested/directed. But being effectively ignored and then <i>berated</i> for trying to help? Ridiculous.</p><p>tt-rss worked okay for my needs (lacked polish), but still, no software is perfect, so if I were to continue using tt-rss, I'd undoubtedly run into other bugs. Going by my experience with abrasive/abusive behavior of the developer (I saw similar examples in other bugs in the tracker at the time), I decided to jump ship on the first sign of a reasonable alternative. Thankfully, Feedly came along, and I hopped on for the ride.

                  Yes, I had a similar experience with the maintainer when trying to contribute back to tt-rss (two pull requests closed with rather rude explanations that suggested my submissions had barely been glanced at).<p>Still, tt-rss offers killer features for me that other options don't: self-hostable, being able to write my own scraper plugins (the big one in this discussion), and a solid Android app. So I continue to use it and just keep any code improvements to myself.

                  After Google Reader, I tried a bunch of different ones. Feedly was the best I could find but there were a number of things that just annoyed me. I had an issue with one of my feeds and got very little help from their support.<p>That was the last straw and I decided to revisit alternatives. I somehow stumbled upon BazQux, and I noticed the same issue with the one feed on that platform as well. The developer was incredibly helpful in pointing out an issue with the way I was generating the feed. That level of support instantly had me hooked (along with how much it functioned like Google Reader). I bought a life time subscription then and there.</p><p>You should check it out!

                  Facebook and Twitter both used to have RSS feeds, and stopped supporting RSS to force people to use their ad-heavy client interfaces.  But that's not where the good stuff is.  While "social" has dropped RSS, it's still doing great for real news.

                  I wrote a simple Twitter API to RSS script and have been using that to read Twitter (via Feedly) for a few years now. The downside is that you don't get tweets at anything even approaching real time (Feedly seems to hit my RSS once every 6 hours), but I find it just perfect for low volume Twitter feeds (like bands announcing new releases or shows).

                  There is still the option to make your own client or just buy something like Tweetbot which has no ads.<p>But I hear you. I find Twitter unusable without 3rd party client, and I think that is affecting my experience in an indirect way as well. I think the fact most people see ML picked tweets has caused fewer people responding to what I share now versus 4 years back.

                  Funny, I've set up a RSS reader again just this week.<p>Prior to that, my main source of information was google feed (when you sweep right on android main screen - for those who don't know it, it's a feed of news curated by google supposed to match our interests). I totally loved it, as it properly detected my interests and shown articles about them even from websites I don't know about.</p><p>But lately, I saw more and more posts I wasn't interested in. Well, it always happened, but those made me wondering because they were posts about brands, or very specific products. Was this promoted content? I don't have a clue.</p><p>Be it promoted content or not, I realized I was vulnerable: anything could be pushed to me and I would think I see it because I'm interested in it. And I have no way of checking why something appears in my feed.</p><p>So I decided to get back to RSS, and realized I could still have the discovery of new sources using... google alerts. I can set a google alerts using the advanced search semantics of google search, and get the result as a RSS feed. This means I discover new sources and I can verify why it appeared (it matches my custom search). Best of both world.</p><p>And obviously, I can also subscribe to specific RSS feeds to be sure to not miss something I love.

                  Being pro-active about telling it which topics or sources you don't like helps a lot. My only wish is to say that I don't like a specific article. Often I get an article on a topic from a source I generally like but the specific article is junk.

                  When the last election's campaigns were ramping up, I went into my Google interests sections and made every effort to tell it I was disinterested in politics and the 2 big names. I only started getting MORE political content until it overwhelmed my feed. For a few months I tried swiping it all away whenever I checked, but seemed to get zero response. I then started telling it I'm not interested in any stories from any sources that report anything political. In other words, I blocked the mainstream media. It got significantly better, but it still tries to shoehorn in a few articles on these topics by pulling from obscure local news outlets that are from the other side of the country.

                  A lot of people don't seem to be aware of it, but you can "tune" Google News by adding or deleting sources. I've tweaked mine quite a bit and it works well as a lazy news source. It's not as finely granulated as my RSS consumption, and it won't replace my RSS reader, but it's better than I at first thought it would be after adjusting the defaults.

                  Funny story, Google News, the web interface seems to have been abondonned by Google. The normal web interface that is, don't know about mobile. The "Sources" preference on news.google.com has a bug - whenever you try to block a new source, it replaces the old one, so you can only ever block one source at a time :D<p>Which isn't sufficient as their feed keeps showing material from Daily Mail and similar garbage. Skipping it manually isn't a problem, but it does take the space of meaningful news reports.</p><p>Users sent countless bug reports and started many threads on their forums since around June 2017, no reply. Nowadays I just aggregate aljazeera and reuters, way more efficient.

                  I've given up on that but haven't sought alternatives. I'm not sure what began influencing my feed, but even after removing sources, choosing what was useful and what I wasn't interested in, it still mainly gives me popular and political news, which were never set in my interests.<p>Other than that, it gives me information that's a day late, which makes things like one-day sales notifications for not useful.</p><p>I've largely switched to podcasts to make up for the content gap but would be interested in a aggregator that didn't try so hard to be smart.

                  I work for a company that tried to do exactly this and we ended up pivoting to enterprise once our technology matured.  The money just isn't there, that's why this service doesn't exist. Podcasts are cheap to host and easy enough to produce that nobody is going to invest serious money unless they are a big producer like Gimlet, Slate, NPR, etc.  In those cases they have their own resources and technology stacks.  There's little need to rely on a third party like us.<p>Everybody else just used YouTube.

                  Well, distribution is fairly centralized [ADDED: in practice through iTunes/Google Play/etc.] and the hosting of the actual podcasts is cheap enough that throwing them on S3 or wherever isn't really a burden for most people. And advertising, when it exists at all, tends to be native advertising.<p>&gt; The space is endearing - maybe that's why it is so vibrant?</p><p>That's true but arguably YouTube at least started out that way as well. I suspect that there are a number of factors; no single one I can think of (except maybe the hosting costs and that seems an unsatisfactory explanation by itself) really captures it.

                  I think it's decentralized partly because itunes doesn't integrate with any other services. So to serve android and IOS many podcasters NEED a single RSS feed that they point iTunes and other services to. Many relatively small services exist to help with hosting, and usually provide a hosted RSS link independent of itunes/whatever.<p>I really hate that many podcasters are trying to push their own app or their publishers / organizations app (even NPR is doing this). Getting everyone using the same platform is how podcasts will get youtubified.

                  The biggest thing I was surprised about when I started a podcast is that iTunes doesn't host or distribute podcasts. As an end-user, I thought I was getting iTunes content with podcasts. But in reality it's just an aggregator like reddit or HN: it's full of links, but those links are external and pull content from other places.<p>I was also surprised by how easy (and free) it is to get a podcast on iTunes, especially compared to getting an app on the App Store.

                  I suspect that a lot of it's just historical happenstance. Podcasting as we think of it today started ~2003 and was very intertwined with the development of RSS. The click-wheel iPod (which was really the breakout model) wasn't until the next year. And the current era of podcasting didn't really take off until it became easy to sync with smartphones.<p>So this was a case where Apple sort of came along for the ride and didn't see podcasting as being a big deal--which they were sort of right about; arguably even today it's somewhat mainstream but I'd bet the majority of people in the US have never listened to a podcast and certainly don't listen regularly.

                  Yeah another thing I'm surprised at, being a relatively new podcaster, is how often I approach people/businesses to interview them and they tell me they either don't listen to podcasts or don't even know what they are.

                  On a recent trip back home, I had some downtime and my device was broken, so I threw a bunch of podcasts on the Apple TV.<p>A few weeks later my dad calls to tell me he doesn't know how any of this works, but now he gets amazing content while driving, instead of just listening to the mostly ads that came through his antenna.</p><p>So.. just lack of awareness?

                  Probably all of the above. Plus, for a lot of people, radio is mostly background noise that, in the case of news and talk radio, is always current. And there's always NPR to mostly avoid advertising.<p>Many people don't want to have to deliberately choose content a lot of the time. I've heard people argue that they don't want to always have to use Netflix because they can't just flip on a channel and/or channel surf.

                  Interesting you say that, I got into podcasts recently (a bit late I know) and found the space very confusing. It's kind'of all on iTunes, but not really, you can get them from their source sites, but also some apps have a subset. Understanding the model is not easy. I didn't know it was powered by rss until this thread. I am really pro federation, and I am not deterred, but I am an engineer on HN. I wonder why email, being federated as well, is easy for anyone to grok.

                  The email protocols are hell. Absolute hell. I don’t think anyone truly groks how it works all the way down either.<p>A big difference is that email has slowly been developed over a period of decades, and so a lot of great software (both libs and GUIs) were built on top of it, and “perfected” over the time.</p><p>Maybe what prevented RSS from reaching the same level of development is that RSS is only <i>composed</i> by “creators”, while email has no target audience.

                  An example: My server sends notification emails to the company automatically. Everyone is using gmail to view their emails.<p>When there is an update about a previous notification, I send an email with the in-reply-to header. Oh wait, gmail doesn't use that.</p><p>Alright, I'll just make sure that the subject line is exactly the same as the original notification (as gmail says to do). This works for a bit, but if someone hits reply-all, suddenly the subject line for the thread is now "Re: &lt;the original subject&gt;" and my followups no longer thread.</p><p>I'll just make sure that my followups always have "Re: " in them, so they thread whether or not people have been communicating on the thread. This mostly works, but if the update is a week or two later, gmail just decides they shouldn't thread.</p><p>This is on top of the fact that emails with similar subject lines occasionally thread together. This gets really annoying when you send automated emails where the subjects are the same except for an identifier of some sort (specifically to prevent threading).</p><p>And there's no way to give feedback to gmail about this. No way to forcefully thread or de-thread emails. You are just given the choice of gmail's threading or no threading at all.

                  Email is still pretty simple. It’s the stuff around email that has appeared for source validating and spam prevention that has complicated it...and really that’s not any one persons fault. Just people trying to solve a hard problem.<p>SPF, DKIM and DMARC seem to be making a real dent here though. DKIM is the most complicated to implement and manage since ideally you want to periodically rotate the keys and it has to be implemented at the sending server level instead of the DNS.

                  Open solutions are always more confusing than centralised ones. End user podcast apps try to hide all the details an make it look like "here's an app with podcasts in it". But behind the scenes it is wonderfully messy. Same with email.<p>Any time you try to make things work without a single central point it makes the whole thing harder to grasp and explain. Open ID was another example. End-user contact points try to simplify things by "productizing" the offering and hiding the implementation details, with various degrees of success.

                  True. But it certainly fell from grace. Prior to social media it was (paraphrasing) "Follow me via RSS" than morphed into "Follow me on social." Even site where RSS is baked in (i.e., WordPress) stopped mentioning it.<p>It never went away, but it certainly (sadly) got a serious demotion.

                  iTunes doesn't host any podcast files. You (as a podcast host) provide them an RSS link and when an end-user subscribes to your podcast, iTunes merely grabs your RSS feed and has the end-user's phone download the latest episode from your servers.<p>The episodes are stores and distributed from the podcast host's own server. The podcast app is just an RSS feed reader.

                  If you haven’t tried RSS as your main mode of information consumption in a while, you should give it a shot. I went all-in on RSS recently and it’s been great. Way more thoughtful, long form content. Smaller dose information sources (Twitter, etc.) are useful in their own way, but I’ve found that the amount of time required to create a unit of media is a pretty good reverse indicator of how likely it is to use the baser emotions to acquire and keep my attention.

                  I very much look forward to the day when ActivityPub becomes more pervasive in platforms...beyond websites/apps that interact directly with other sites/apps and other use-cases, ActivityPub should be a boon to comment systems.  (I myself am in favor of decentralized comment systems...then again I'm biased IN FAVOR of most any decentralized platforms/systems. ;-)

                  Agreed. I was glad when npr.org removed their Disqus comments sections. Disqus comments on news websites tend to be very nasty and stain websites more often than not IMO. Disqus comments on <i>local</i> news sites are an absolute cesspool.

                  RSS is, fundamentally, just links to web pages. Why would it need to have built-in commenting? Just go to the linked page and comment there.

                  We don't need it to have comments. But I think the lack of commenting is the big problem of an RSS focused ecosystem.<p>Shooting comments off into the ether is fine by clicking the page and commenting there. But, if you have a couple of dozen blogs in your RSS feed, and leave a handful of comments a day, clicking back through the specific place to see if you've been responded to is way too much effort. Sites like HN, Reddit, and Facebook, have a central mechanism by which you can be notified.</p><p>In the '10s I had a blog with over 1000 readers, I had fewer comments, and less community than the replacement Facebook group has with a fraction of that number.</p><p>That may not be a problem for publishers who are purely interested in eyeballs. But that isn't all of them. If the aim is to free content from the walled garden (which I think is an important goal), then it matters.

                  Any decent commenting system lets you receive reply notifications. If some of them don't, the solution is to fix that, not split the userbase by constructing an entirely new, parallel comment system.

                  I'm not sure what you mean, sorry.<p>I've seen email notifications, but to me they are just as bad as subscribing to a lot of sites by email. That's kind of what RSS is for: aggregation. So yes, it means you don't have to click through sites, I accept that, but still not a good user experience. If you mean something else, let me know, I am interested.</p><p>I don't know what you mean by splitting the user base or constructing a parallel comment system. I'm just talking about how to provide commenting, as a content publisher. RSS + on-site page by page commenting (even with email notifications) has a fraction of the engagement (in my anecdotal experience) of FB.

                  Don't most blogging platforms have the option to email replies?  In any case, I prefer a bit of friction in the comment process, since it discourages people from "shooting off" without thinking.

                  Usenet with dial-up was good for this.  You'd compose your reply, then look it back up, read over, amend, perhaps delete or send later.  It made for more considered responses.<p>I've noticed with HN it's very swarm-like and transient these days.  Comment following is also difficult without some thread control.  At a minimum you need collapsible threads.  Too much to read, don't bother, say something that's been said already - and add to the noise.  Or have a bypassed dangling leaf comment.

                  I completely agree. When did RSS go out of style anyway?<p>The other day I wanted to subscribe to an author's posts on Medium, but I couldn't find a RSS feed anywhere, so I never did. Seems like a loss for the author to me, seeing as gaining influence and credibility is probably the goal of many who write posts. It would also seem as if Medium doesn't want to add RSS as it would take control away in terms of recommending content to people, etc. |

                  &gt; When did RSS go out of style anyway?<p>It went away when Google killed Reader. Reader had more or less killed off the independent RSS reader market. When it got shuttered, alternatives weren't well developed and people shifted more or less entirely onto Twitter. The Twitter shift had been happening already but the shutdown kind of forced the issue.

                  I think you and HN in general vastly overstates the gravitas of the Google Reader shutdown. I loved it too but the demise of RSS happened probably more because of people switching to Twitter, Facebook and others as their "aggregator" than by killing off one RSS-Reader.

Reader was extremely popular (and well outside of IT circles - I still hear from librarians, scientists, policy wonks, etc. who are bitter about Google taking away their information filter. In DC it was common to see other people on metro in the morning with the popular mobile apps open, just like you now see the Facebook blue) and the social network there was quite active until the day Google shut it down and forced everyone into the alpha-quality Google+.

                  They did have comments and other social elements [0]. It was possible to follow people and share articles with or without adding your own note to it. They had a bookmarklet that allowed you to share any article, even if it didn't have an RSS feed. Their move to Google+ sharing wasn't exactly an improvement though [1].<p>I never got why people moved to Twitter, it wasn't, and isn't, as good at consuming or sharing content as Reader was. It's just one more step towards the more centralized web we have today, and hopefully we will move back to a more decentralized experience soon.</p><p>[0] <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.se/2009/03/google-reader-is-your-new-watercooler.html" target="_blank">http://googlereader.blogspot.se/2009/03/google-reader-is-you...</a>

                  The same could kinda be said for YouTube. That is, Goggle had a massive and active community, but it needed some tweaks. Instead they build Google Plus and wait for they to come. We know that outcome :)<p>I think the problem with RSS was - and still is? - is the data it provides. A social network can harvest MUCH more data (due to the endless number of connections between "the nodes.") RSS is too old school.</p><p>Put another way, imagine being hired by Google - while FB and Twitter are taking off - and being told you're going to work on a new & improved RSS reader. That would have triggered a mass exit.

                  Not true at all. Alternatives were already available when Google Reader(GR) closed, i.e. July 2013. Inoreader, which was feature-complete in regards to GR, was launched a month after the announcement in March. That's why Feedly hogged most of the momentum as it was released in 2008 already.<p>I would say Google Reader's discontinuation actually increased the popularity of RSS. The protocol was big news for a few weeks, and it sparked a lot of new services which made news themselves.</p><p>I don't know whether feeds usage was growing but it was not comparable to social media. At that time papers were increasingly adding paywalls and didn't show any signs of embracing feeds any further.

                  Why not just an RSS aggregator program / app?  Like those which preceded and continued after Google Reader.  They're no more difficult to use, you just add feeds and the program does the rest.  And no login required.<p>It seems odd to me to take a federated protocol, centralise it in a proprietary system and then shrug and forget RSS when that goes away.</p><p>I was on Akgregator for years, then Bamboo in Firefox, now on QuiteRSS now that Quantum has killed Bamboo.

                  Feedly's mobile app has pretty bad UX (or at least that's been my experience every time I try installing it on Android).<p>For example, in the article list view, there's a single basically-identical swipe left/right gesture to...</p><pre><code>  * mark single article as read
  * mark single article as unread
  * mark all articles on page as read
  * mark all articles on page as unread
</code></pre>
The difference between marking a single article and marking all articles <i>seems</i> to be based on how far you've swiped, but if (for example) you don't release your swipe and keep moving your finger further after it's marked all as read, it suddenly does the <i>opposite</i> and marks all articles as unread. The direction of the swipe (left or right) doesn't seem to control whether you're marking read/unread -- it's (in my experience) been completely arbitrary what it decides to do, regardless of swipe direction. It's ridiculous how painful it is, and it's basically been this way for as long as I can remember.<p>The app has really poor bulk management of articles, so I just turn to other apps. Currently I'm using News+, which has superior bulk management capabilities... but it hasn't been updated in forever (and is buggy in other ways).

                  Google shutting down Reader 'killed' RSS and made people move to Twitter? You might want to look outside the cage a bit, the world is a lot bigger.

                  That is a keen observation. I guess rss is a technology from simpler and more explorative times of the internet instead of the current oppressive and commercialized phase we are going through now.

                  Eh, the surveillance was weaker, but I'm not sure about the commercialization. RSS is from 99/00, the era of Punch The Monkey flash banner ads and dozens of popups and popunders.<p>From what I can tell, RSS was the equivalent of today's OpenGraph. It was a tool for a company (Netscape) to slurp content into its portal. It's just that AOL then blundered when they bought Netscape and removed support for RSS, which then became a de-facto standard format.</p><p>In fact, as RSS popularity wanes, a feed reader that can reader OG tags is probably a good idea.

                  Not that strange, every site on which I've looked for it has RSS/atom feeds where relevant, but hide them (eg this, github, etc).<p>Interestingly enough, Firefox has a "feeds" section when looking at page info, which will show RSS feeds included in the meta tags (which they all seem to be).</p><p>So really, I've never stopped using RSS, not sure how to go "back" to it.

                  That's the actual problem. I don't get why everyone is putting such a strong emphasis on the google reader shutdown. It's the fact that everyone stopped providing RSS feeds. Probably because you can't put 500 tracking pixels and ads and scripts in them, so they hope by shutting them down people will visit the page directly more frequently. Which might actually work out in general.

                  I have not experienced this. In my experience only niche, self-built websites offer no RSS feed. Plus there are other ways to make your RSS feed "useless" by only providing a title and the opening sentence, that way people will have to visit your site for the full content.

                  To me, RSS and Twitter/FB/etc are very different things. With RSS you are „alone“ while reading it. There’s no one to discuss things with you. I‘m not really qualified to make this statement, but I‘d say RSS feeds don’t have a social component, leaving your limbic system (responsible for social interaction) widely out of the process. You process the info and that’s it.<p>With Twitter, everything is attached to a social context. If a link is posted by your personal idol, you engage in (pseudo?) social behavior if you read it. You may then feel compelled to discuss it, and you will feel rejected if nobody answers, or very good if you get a lot of likes. So, lots of limbic/social interaction.</p><p>Both have their merits.. without Twitter, I would have a content discovery problem, and with (only) Twitter I‘ll live in a bubble, plus my IRL social interactions might be somewhat crowded out by the interactions on Twitter, plus Twitter can make me feel socially miserable for very petty reasons.</p><p>Personally I would love a system that combines my personal RSS feed with recommendations resulting from mining Twitter and applying ML to generate relevant results.

                  Well, one reason Google Reader’s closure was such a loss was because it added a social layer to RSS. And it was a completely optional and non-intrusive social layer. I really wish Google had tried to enhance Reader instead of killing it to promote Google+. Allowing the ability to post short messages in your shared feeds would have made it very Twitter like, only nicer.

                  Agreed. Imagine having an RSS feed for all the posts here on Hackernews and just reading that instead. I come here mainly for the comments - and not usually to debate or discuss even - a lot of times to contextualize the content in question because inevitably someone more knowledgeable will post their thoughts about it. RSS is not a panacea and it is no replacement for social platforms.

                  Major reason why I moved away from Feedly and The Old Reader and now use Inoreader: no limitation of number of feeds for the free version

                  I dropped Feedly for the most basic reason possible: it didn't display my feeds readably. I read a lot of math blogs and the TeX formulas in them didn't show up in Feedly (and maybe a few did appear but with incorrect spacing). Inoreader renders them just fine.<p>This was years ago, and back there was already a feature request on Feedly's website asking for this to be fixed. I just took a look at that request it looks exactly the same, so either they haven't done anything about this (most likely) or they fixed it but forgot to close the issue.

                  I just open the actual site when that happens, which makes the feature a convenience rather than a necessity. I can't remember the last time that happened to me though. If this were affecting me regularly I'd probably feel like you.

                  Whenever I'm on slow internet I appreciate loading "mobilized content" - it will show you contents of the article right on the site. Also in general it felt a lot faster than feedly (left 2yrs ago though, feedly might've changed).

                  How do you get "mobilized content" in Inoreader? My experience using both now is that Inoreader cuts off some of my longer feeds at the fold with a link to the site while Feedly displays the entire contents of every article.

                  I've always had Feedly set to display the full article in the reader. It's been a feature since the day I switched from Google Reader. Is "mobilized content" different from that?

                  I've continued using RSS for years, even when it was a "dying" technology.  It certainly never died for me, and is super useful.  It's probably the first app I reach for in the morning.  I use a few apps not mentioned here.  Each is for a Unix/Linux platform:  Newsbeuter is a console RSS feeder that's a dream if you prefer keyboard driven software.  You can update one feed or all of them, search across all feeds for key words, export to OPML, etc.  I also used curn, a java app that can email you your custom feed update whenever you run it with cron.  Lastly, rawdog updates feeds and publishes a custom web page.  I use it on a VPS running a webserver, and visit it from wherever I like.  RSS has been a good way for me to stay in touch with individual bloggers etc who publish sporadically.  And I inherently distrust any software that wants to customize a feed for me based on my interests, etc.  I always suspect they are more focused on pushing to me what others have paid them to push, than showing me what they think I'll like.  How can any paid company ever keep straight those two inherently different things?  ("Here, I think you'd like this because I earn money if you do").

                  Agreed. I switched to Inoreader after several weeks of looking for an alternative to Google Reader and I haven't looked back since. I've had a great experience; their Android app is very good and they seem to have a reasonable business model.<p>The UIs on Feedly and Newsblur didn't suit me at all. As I recall Feedly made it very difficult to even read the articles. Inoreader has the nice two-column view Google Reader and mail apps like Fastmail use.

                  I had the same issue with Feedly's "features". I've maintained a stylish extension for Feedly that I keep adding to. Every time they add something that I don't want to see, I hide it via css.  Thanks for the prompt, I just hid the patronising "Well done" that's been annoying me.<p>If anyone else wants to try to strip feedly back, they can try my css here:

                  I’m viewing RSS on feedly.com for years. I just checked the features in Feedly Pro. It says that the free tier is limited to 100 sources, while Pro gets you unlimited sources. What does this mean? I’ve already added over 500 sources and it seems to work fine.

                  Indeed. I just tried Feedly on Android and it just gets in the way. It's awful. Suggestions are disgustingly location aware (why am I getting only feeds from my mother language?).<p>I need folders and a panel to read my rss feeds, everything else is fancy SPAM.

                  Eh, I dunno. The light gamification of every. single. thing. I interact with definitely gets old. Some times I just want a tool to be a tool, not an interactive "experience" that tells me "good job!" or gives me a Gold Star after I perform random task X.<p>If given the choice between a service that just does its job, and one that 'engages me as a user', I'd tend to choose the former most of the time -- doubly so for something like a reader.

                  Engage where? Engage how? Tech savvy may not be what you're looking for, and is not always a good thing.<p>I think what fulldecent is saying is that people reading on RSS have a barrier to sharing and a barrier to commenting that doesn't exist on social media. On Twitter or Facebook, the "share" action is intrinsically linked to the article in its native format. Not so on RSS.

                  I've been wanting to set something like this up with Hacker News. The problem is that you have to do it two-stage; your website needs to go live, then you need to post it (so you can get the post url), then you need to update the website.<p>It's not insurmountable, it's just a bit harder than it should be to automate, especially if you're running a static site or something that takes a minute or two to go live. I'd love if social sites had some kind of API for settting up a draft post or deterministic urls, so you could pre-include the link during your build step.

                  Hot take: we should revive ATOM instead.<p>RSS and ATOM are both nearly always machine generated and machine read so this may seem trivial to argue, but for those who are interesting in seeing the difference, this is a good article <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/Rss20AndAtom10Compared" target="_blank">http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/Rss20AndAtom10Compared</a></p><p>--------</p><p>When I wrote a forum software a while back, it was trivial to not only add a feed for new threads but also for new comments (per thread and board-wide). Made it very easy to monitor updates on all my devices. Most wikis have RSS/ATOM feeds for recent changes which is a great power feature for admins.</p><p>Mastodon is atom-based, I believe. Early twitter supported RSS / ATOM feeds which arguably made it easier to follow hashtags or news accounts.</p><p>Another benefit of RSS/ATOM is that you can plug them into chatbots or use them to mirror content.

                  This brings back memories of the syndication-format wars.<p>And not good ones, either. RSS 0.9x versus RSS 1.0 versus RSS 2.0 versus Atom versus CDF versus whatever else people came up with, and which formats are relatively self-contained versus which ones had to go borrow elements from other XML namespaces and whether you should "helpfully" supplement your feed (or even your XHTML!) with stuff pulled from Dublin Core, which formats have associated publishing protocols that actually work, the mess of trying to fit arbitrary content formats into feeds and bumping into XML arcana along the way and encouraging people to put autodiscovery links in their sites and...</p><p>Thankfully, for many years now I've published only an Atom feed, and it works, and that's that. And for reading I use Reeder, with a paid service that tracks my subscriptions and read/unread status, and it seems to just work. That wasn't always the case.

                  I'd been on The Old Reader ever since Google Reader shut down. Tried Bazqux thanks to a post here on HN and switched because it's much faster. Very noticeable with a lot of subscriptions (I have over 100).<p>Only relative downside is that there's no integration with Firefox's "Subscribe to this page" button, which TOR has. That means you need to use a javascript bookmark to subscribe to new feeds, which feels kludge-ey in comparison.

                  I used RSS while Google reader existed, and I stopped using it for a few years after it disappeared.<p>Now, I'm using a service that sends some RSS feed to my email so so can read them directly from there. I think it's amazing as it has all the features I need (tagging, mark read / unread) and I don't need to open another website / application to read my news.

                  Hey Wired, maybe RSS would be more popular if media outlets like you would put more in your RSS feeds than a title and single sentence for each article.<p>But I get it. You need ads to make money, and just putting ads in your RSS feed is not enough because they're not "interactive" enough, or something. You need those "engagement" metrics that you generate by making readers press a button to read the full article.</p><p>I was trying and fell short of something witty to say.

I tried to submit an improvement to the author directly to explicitly allow HTTPS URLs in light of upcoming iTunes changes to enforce HTTPS; they said by email that of course HTTPS resources are valid in their view, but they weren't prepared to actively update the spec to say as much. Until that's done some feed validators continue to mark HTTPS resources as invalid.

RSS, Atom, JSON, microformats, whatever; there are libraries that can parse any of these. What matters is the idea behind them, the technical implementation is secondary. Please don't revive the format wars.

                  RSS is good enough for what it was made for and most of the parser libraries and software parse both Atom and RSS (all 0.9, 1.0 and 2.0).

                  I built a tiny website back in 2005-ish to aggregate RSS feeds from sites that I was interested in.  Just for myself and didn't think too much that it could have been an actual product.  That was before Google Reader launching in October 2005.  Today it's sad to see Google Reader discontinued.<p>Somehow I find this article very interesting in that it's kind of a sandwich that the promotion of Feedly is inserted in the middle, which makes me wonder if the article really wants to advocate the revival of RSS, or is just another marketing one.

                  Hi Tony, just to be clear, it is not a promotion for us, we've been interviewed as well as all the other readers and only a fraction of what we've been asked was published. We had no control to review how the final article will look like either. -Petr @ Feedly

I have never consumed news primarily on social media, I subscribe to hundreds of feeds and that's always where I get my news from.<p>I use Feedly with the wonderful Nextgen Reader client for Windows. 10/mobile.

                  Shameless plug: We created <a href="https://contentgems.com" target="_blank">https://contentgems.com</a> as a feed reader on steroids: You can follow feeds, however you can also filter them based on powerful keyword based search (and other params). You can follow the CG firehose (tens of thousands of feeds we follow and index for you), to discover new feeds. And then you can curate and share the best articles from CG. It's a mashup of Feedly, Google Alerts, Buffer, and IFTTT/Zapier.

                  I use TinyTinyRSS. Works pretty well. Fully free unlike services such as Feedly, just like Reader was back in the day.<p>Works well on any shared hosting or VPS etc. as long as you've got PHP/MySQL/Postgres and the ability to setup a CRON job (CPanel/Plesk give you this) or the daemon.

                  Agreed. It is an API world. I recall trying make sense of xml then came RSS feeds. Then, why JSON, and now you can have RSS like feeds (and a lot more) via JSON.

                  I'm interested in a reader that focuses on efficiency; like probably most people, no matter how much I try to cull them I end up with too many items in my list, more than I have time for.<p>Let's say it takes an average of 2.5 seconds to read a feed item subject line, decide whether to read it[0], and nothing else - not opening or reading any articles. In half an hour of concentration you could do that with ~700 feed items - again, without reading one article. Let's call 700 feed items a generous maximum; I doubt many will want to devote 30 minutes of their day only to reviewing feed items.</p><p>I end up with far more than 700 and I know I'm not the only one. How can I make it faster?</p><p>1. Obviously, the UI must not slow me down in any way.</p><p>2. Deduplication</p><p>3. Grouping of feed items covering the same topic. There may be dozens of items covering the march last weekend: If I don't want to read about it, I can ignore them en masse. If I do want to read about it, I can select the best looking feed item from the group and ignore the rest.</p><p>4. Display summaries instead of articles, at least optionally. If an item interests me, I can read the RSS summary and possibly save reading full articles that don't interest me or for which the summary contains the info I want.</p><p>... Is there a reader that does all that? Even if I have to pay for it? And it's still not enough; I doubt I could efficiently process all the items using only above. What else can be done?</p><p>[0] Source: I just timed myself doing that with 10 feed items in 26 seconds

                  Stress from bolded lines of unread articles can be overwhelming.<p>In FeedDemon, a desktop based reader, there is a tool called the Panic button that is triggered when you have a lot of unreads (or that you can trigger manually). It displays the following message:</p><p><i>You have 591 unread articles. This isn't email - you don't have to read everything. Perhaps it's time to hit the panic button and let FeedDemon mark articles as read for you?</i></p><p>Then you can mark all articles older than say 48H or 5 days as read automatically.</p><p>As a basic feature you can group feeds and there is a button that let you mark all articles in a group (or a single feed) as read, so for chatty feeds you can just skim the titles and if nothing mandates further reading you can clear it up.</p><p>The real trick though for me is to revisit your RSS list regularly, say once a year, and not be afraid to remove or filter feeds that post too many articles. Some big blogs in their niche post several "news" pieces per day.</p><p>What was great was Yahoo Pipes, where you could filter, merge and transform feeds into new feeds. So you could grab a feed from a chatty blog and filter it on some keyword for the subniche you are interested in, then do that on several sources and merge all these into one consolidated feed.

                  The major feature here would be deduplication, in my opinion. That would be hard to do though as it would have to parse the feed contents (which vary from links to articles to full blow articles sometimes) and use some kind of percentage to determine whether or not it's a dupe? Curious if there is a smarter solution to that feature possibility.

                  FYI Inoreader does some deduplication by default. As you scroll you see a message like 'Filtered one similar article'. I haven't noticed any duplicates. That doesn't help when everyone's talking about the same thing, of course.

The emergence of JSON as an alternative to RSS is a real opportunity here.</p><p>(Side note: Was a long-term Digg Reader user, so its loss was felt.

                  If you already use an email client and have a place to run cron jobs, I highly recommend a feed-&gt;email converter. No need for a separate RSS reader, and you get cross-device syncing for free. Options include feed2email[1], feed2imap[2], and my own feedmail[3] (just "released", but I've been using it for years).

                  I find that I'm far more able to manage information overload by doing the exact opposite and moving non-human email into a newsreader.  Email is for people, not newsletters or notifications.  If you can move as much of the non-automated stuff into feeds as possible, then email actually becomes useful again.  Feedbin has a feature [0] where it gives you an email address that places anything received into a feed, for example.<p>[0] <a href="https://feedbin.com/blog/2016/02/03/subscribe-to-email-newsletters-in-feedbin/" target="_blank">https://feedbin.com/blog/2016/02/03/subscribe-to-email-newsl...</a>

                  I decided to build my own RSS reader a few months back after getting into the habit of consuming news via RSS, and not really being thrilled with any of the readers out there. The source is open and can be pulled/built locally from GitHub[0] or accessed at the public instance for free[1]. It also made it to the front page of HN through a Shown HN post a while back, so at least a few people here enjoyed it (:<p>[0] <a href="https://github.com/jtanza/rufus" target="_blank">https://github.com/jtanza/rufus</a></p><p>[1] <a href="http://rufus.news" target="_blank">http://rufus.news</a>

                  RSS was not discoverable for non-techy users, in part because browser support was clunky and publishers were reluctant to send readers away from their websites (and ads). But these days publishers rely on Twitter and Facebook as a "worse is better" method to syndicate links to their content. Twitter and Facebook are discoverable and sharable.<p>I feel like there is some opportunity to create new personalized social software or services using RSS in a post-Facebook world.

                  Amen.<p>I've been thinking about this a lot lately. But almost nobody is offering RSS at the moment and most publishers who do drop the ball. Feeds are broken or partial.</p><p>It might be time to start from scratch though, I'm not sure RSS is simple enough for normal people. Podcast delivery format would be nice, where you subscribe and discover from one aggregated portal and it's finding similar content and making solid recommendations. Maybe inject some type of medium / rank feature so you can track trending content and subscribe to channels of what's popular.

                  The article asks if "anyone weary of black-box algorithms controlling what you see online" and then offers choices which are either hosted web services or proprietary programs, both of which grant someone else the power to control what you see via that reader. So even though standards everyone is free to implement (RSS is certainly in that set) are critically important it's hard to take some of the article seriously.<p>The real way to avoid the problem of non-freedom and deny the admins/programmers the power to control your reading is to use free software RSS feed readers instead of hosted services you don't host yourself or proprietary programs.

                  Maybe MRSS has a chance. I am old enough to remember the first go around at all this. I remember reading an article during the 1990s on O'Reilly about RSS, semantic web, etc. I used to read Dave Winer's blog pretty regularly. I remember being skeptical at the time and it turns out my skepticism was prescient.<p>Nowadays it seems common to generate MRSS feeds for podcasts and video playlists. Devices like Alexa, Google Home, etc. are taking advantage of this format. Instead of it being used to "free-the-web" it is being used by content aggregators to ease vendor lock-in. This lock-in could not be achieved with textual content (where it is easy to write a competing application) but it can be achieved with hardware devices.</p><p>I'm even more cynical now than I was in the 1990's. I do not see content creators providing unfettered access to their content. The whole point of vendor platforms like Facebook and newer devices like Alexa is that the content is marshalled by the platform NOT the user. Content creators will give that ground to another corporation that they can negotiate with but I don't believe they will ever give it to users directly.

                  I always felt RSS/ATOM were underrated,<p>So in 2015 for the love of RSS and information consumption we set out to build a completely customisable news aggregator app with fast parsing (RSS/ATOM), category selection, reorder categories, notification customisation -(schedule, DND), image toggle, data saving mode, filter, youtube, sharing news with own voice attached called Talk about News - <a href="https://talkabout.co.in/" target="_blank">https://talkabout.co.in/</a></p><p>Sharing news along with voice was the USP, so that the shared content gets more value. While working on this, we saw that not every site followed RSS/ATOM standards we had to individually handle different sites for the shortcomings. I'm certain that, though Feedly started as RSS aggregator they are now parsing the sites as a whole for content for the same reasons.</p><p>By the time we built and released it, we understood Facebook has become the defacto news consumption source and without big marketing budget; our project was dead as soon as it arrived. We tried to salvage the tech and re-brand it as 'build your own app'for bloggers, but it didn't take off.</p><p>But we did take the voice sharing feature from TaN to another product called larynx, as we understood the 'News' in the name of Talk about News was one of the main inhibitors for downloads.</p><p>larynx (PH) - <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/larynx" target="_blank">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/larynx</a></p><p>Note: If any of you tried the app and if didn't work as expected; my apologies as the app hasn't been actively developed for years now & the website exists only for historical reasons.

                  I never stopped using RSS. I follow a few hundred blogs (many of them have only very very few posts. Rule of thumb: The lower the post frequency, the higher the quality). I host my  tinyRSS. I consider offering it to the public for free.<p>Here is a good RSS feed for Hackernews:

                  I've been aggregating my news for my own use recently so I can keep a database of articles and grab articles from more sources than just RSS (some are parsed out of HTML).<p>The Python code for some of the sources is here: <a href="https://github.com/wybiral/stream-sources" target="_blank">https://github.com/wybiral/stream-sources</a></p><p>On my network there's a bunch of those stream sources feeding into a Golang server that stores the articles and aggregates the ones I'm interested in for real-time updates/alerts.</p><p>The nice thing is that I can attach temporary scrapers with alerts to monitor status pages and other updates that don't use RSS or anything.</p><p>IMO WebSocket API's or streaming HTTP make more sense than RSS these days.

                  I dislike most RSS/Atom readers for the same reason.

                  I've been using the same method for about 16 years thanks to Firefox. RSS toolbar feeds[0] have been supported since Firefox was in beta (Phoenix). I never did use Google Reader, I viewed that as for the kids! Came and went and I never paid any attention to it, didn't need it and I waited out its existence apparently.<p>RSS toolbar feeds are also the reason I never switched to Chrome, ever. Google never wanted anyone to have ad-free RSS feeds catch on when they could potentially prevent a site visit.</p><p>For my iOS solution, I use Feedly by simply subscribing to the same sources as I do in Firefox. Not much else is necessary. Other than picking up Feedly for mobile, same tool all this time.</p><p>[0]<a href="https://i.imgur.com/6LTAie1.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/6LTAie1.png</a>

                  True. RSS gives control over what and how we consume information. The curated newsfeed is prone to gaming and misuse. In fact, we should be able to select feeds, curation engines and reader apps. This way it would be less of a "platform" and more of "www".

                  The issue of control with newsfeeds and RSS has been on my mind a lot the last year or so.<p>RSS and Atom are great as a protocol, but where things break down for me is in discovery, filtering, and selection of content.</p><p>There's a few traditional RSS/Atom readers I like, because I have complete control over the feeds I monitor. The problem with this is that then I have complete control over the feeds, and have no way to be alerted to content I might have otherwise missed. I think this is part of the "unread feed overload" problem mentioned by some others, that I just a firehose of feeds at me, with no prioritization of content.</p><p>The other end are more curated things, like Feedly. This is great, because I get alerted to things that are popular, but they're very centralized, and it seems like the more you get curation, the less often you're able to customize your feeds. Also, for whatever reason, with the curated systems, it seems like you kind of get the same things over and over again from different systems, like there's a set of feeds they all dip into and don't deviate from.</p><p>This is my ideal in an RSS/Atom reader (not saying it's realistic):</p><p>1. Open source</p><p>2. Good UI</p><p>3. Can import and export using OPML or other similar standard open format</p><p>4. Cross-platform, between desktop and mobile</p><p>5. Decentralized feed recommendation</p><p>The last part is where things go a little off the beaten path, which is that it would be nice to have some way to get introduced to popular content without it going through some centralized service, like a recommendation system that's decentralized.

                  Google reader was introduced, made it look like it would be there forever and cost nothing, which killed any alternatives. Then Google killed reader in favor of Google+. At that point, there was no good reader, and even with not-as-good alternatives like feedly, a lot of people didn't feel like setting things up again. As a result, the whole ecosystem was knocked out of balance and never recovered.

                  Premium RSS feeds are one option, as well as putting only a brief summary of the article into the RSS with a link to the full site.  The monetization model will probably look similar to Twitter, except without needing to dodge algorithmic uncertainty since RSS is a pure feed.<p>Plus, Outlook does have an RSS feed function.  The incentive can be the same as newsletter publication.  It just depends on how you want to reach people.

                  RSS never stopped being a thing for me. When Google Reader shut down, which I still miss, I moved over to Digg Reader, and now that that is shutting down I finally decided to try out Feedly which I like so far. I just like curating my own content.

Been using a desktop based newsfeed for more than a decade.<p>And since we are using it to have a more focused experience, less clutter, etc. it seems logical to have it away from the browser where distractions are just a click away.

                  Hello founder of Panda here, you can use <a href="http://usepanda.com" target="_blank">http://usepanda.com</a> to read RSS as well. Right now you can add maximum 3 RSS feeds for free. With pro account you can add unlimited feeds. (It's as low as $2.99 per month) We're planning to start a Patreon campaign and our goal is to make all the premium features free for all the users as we reach our goals on the platform. As soon as we reach $2000 we'll make RSS feeds free for everyone. Hope you guys give it a try :)
