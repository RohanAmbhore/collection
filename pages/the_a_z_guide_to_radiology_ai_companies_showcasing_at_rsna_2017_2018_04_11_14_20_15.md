Note I didn’t say largest ‘radiology’ conference. Nope — the world’s largest conference, regardless of sector anywhere in the world, starts once again in the windy city of Chicago. The <a href="http://www.rsna.org/Annual_Meeting.aspx" target="_blank">Radiological Society of North America’s annual conference</a> boasts upwards of 50,000 physical attendees, thousands of virtual ones, and tonnes of vendors and software providers. All of these people will pack into the absolutely vast 2.6million square feet of <a href="http://www.mccormickplace.com/" target="_blank">McCormick Place</a> (the world’s largest convention center), bringing with them, I kid you not, up to 30 full size MRI scanners. It is quite literally the epicenter of the global radiology community’s calendar, and something to breath-taking to behold. Just have a look at the <a href="http://www.expocad.com/host/fx/rsna/rsna17/exfx.html?zoomto=8062,8044,8542,8361&units=F#floorplan" target="_blank">floorplan for the exhibitors</a> — it’s like a mini-city!</p><figure id="96d9"><div><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/105/1*S3PrwUCLKGxnVBbcnyDUqA.png?q=20" /><div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*S3PrwUCLKGxnVBbcnyDUqA.png" /></div></figure><p id="5085">As I make my plans to head over, I thought I’d do some research on the expanding number of artificial intelligence start-ups and companies who have booked in to show-off their tech in the Machine Learning Showcase arena.

They are ISO 13485 certified, and planning launch of a CE marked product this year — very likely it will be showcased at RSNA.

The team did win Israel’s Digital Health start-up competition in 2016, so that’s something. They claim to have developed “a new kind of deep learning technology that can detect high-level abnormalities”, so let’s hope they have something to show at RSNA.</p><h3 id="dfdb"><a href="https://arterys.com/" target="_blank">Arterys</a></h3><figure id="1ae9"><div><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/105/1*iWYKTjC-8na6I8nFeo68Tw.png?q=20" /><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*iWYKTjC-8na6I8nFeo68Tw.png" /></div></figure><p id="d287">Location: San Francisco, USA</p><p id="2348">Founded: 2011</p><p id="e95b">CEO: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabien-beckers-0a026b/" target="_blank">Fabien Beckers</a></p><p id="b6b9">Funding: $13,716,000 in total</p><p id="dc1f">Product: Arterys 4D flow and Cardio DL</p><blockquote id="19d2">“Arterys’ 4D Flow technology generates precise measurements of blood flow non-invasively and non-radiatively anywhere in the body.

Massive funding followed, and Arterys look set to be the firm leaders in cardiac MRI quantitation and segmentation, with other products reportedly in production.</p><h3 id="6d8e"><a href="http://www.blackfordanalysis.com/" target="_blank">Blackford Analysis</a></h3><figure id="a09e"><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*xPkJynuwrJ0KkqkeF9il_w.png" /></div></figure><p id="f852">Location: Edinburgh, Scotland</p><p id="79e2">Founded: 2010</p><p id="63cb">CEO: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benpanter/" target="_blank">Ben Panter</a></p><p id="b363">Funding: £2,410,000 in total</p><p id="47d1">Product: Blackford Workflow Server and Automated Image Registration</p><blockquote id="94c1">“We provide a single platform for quick access to automated image analysis and processing that can be integrated into existing workflows for image capture, storage, interpretation, viewing and sharing.”</blockquote><p id="f149">While not technically a start-up (almost 8 years, and counting) their measured approach has secured a recent partnership with RadNet across America after FDA clearance. Their first AI product on the platform is automated image registration. Going down the platform route instead of aiming for Clinical Decision Support certainly seems to have paid off, and getting a foot in the door in the huge American market will likely be a smart move, allowing Blackford to roll out new algorithms directly into existing clinical partners’ workflows.</p><h3 id="a256"><a href="http://contextflow.com/" target="_blank">ContextFlow</a></h3><figure id="927e"><div><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/105/1*4EJ-tt3tWoo6HkFxZxYtuQ.png?q=20" /><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*4EJ-tt3tWoo6HkFxZxYtuQ.png" /></div></figure><p id="84e1">Location: Vienna, Austria</p><p id="c126">Founded: 2010</p><p id="2b59">CEO: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-holzer-2187219b/" target="_blank">Markus Holzer</a></p><p id="2891">Funding: Undisclosed</p><p id="b86e">Product: Radiology Explorer</p><blockquote id="b59d">“The Radiology Explorer provides contextflow with a simple, accurate and fast image search tool to provide radiologists with a new approach to searching for information. By selecting a region on the radiological image, they can immediately access information, relevant to the actual case, concerning visually similar cases, reference literature and relevant guidelines to provide a faster and more accurate diagnosis.”</blockquote><p id="5c7e">With CE and FDA processes ongoing, ContextFlow’s intelligent search is yet another interesting take on the use of AI in imaging (<a href="https://medium.com/@DrHughHarvey/5-radiology-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-build-and-none-of-them-interpret-medical-images-7a21633f4d6" target="_blank">I wrote previously</a> that this is one of the top 5 uses for radiology AI).

The combined data is presented in a decision support system using Combinostics’ patented disease-state fingerprint-technology.”</blockquote><p id="a403">ISO 13485 certified company Combinostics have CE marked their suite of tools for extracting quantified imaging biomarkers from brain MR. A strong scientific background has put them on firm footing, and their tools see use on the academic circuit, with plenty of publications. Whether or not the technology translates to added value in clinical practice is yet to be seen.</p><h3 id="331d"><a href="https://curacloud.net/" target="_blank">CuraCloud</a></h3><figure id="2171"><div><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/105/1*B-pkTDcCAOugiWQhd_1d3A.png?q=20" /><div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*B-pkTDcCAOugiWQhd_1d3A.png" /></div></figure><p id="6f50">Location: Seattle, USA</p><p id="12b9">Founded: 2016</p><p id="a5e9">CEO: Unknown (!)</p><p id="a249">Funding: Undisclosed</p><p id="77eb">Product: CuraCloud A.I.</p><blockquote id="e29f">“Our proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are uniquely tailored to medical data, adding machine intelligence and automation to challenging steps in medical image analysis, clinical results mining, molecular oncology and other areas of medicine and research.”</blockquote><p id="74ef">I couldn’t find much information about CuraCloud online — their CEO is neither on LinkedIn nor listed on Crunchbase, and they don’t appear on Glassdoor. Their website has a lot of ‘fluff’ about enhancing capabilities and spanning modalities… but not much information on what exactly their product does, nor do they have any regulatory clearances— but from what I can tell they aim to triage imaging exams to present to the radiologist’s workflow, and have a partnership with Clario and an un-named academic institution. They also claim that they aid in digital pathology, NLP for EHR automation and some genomics... a mixed bag with little clarity.</p><h3 id="95af"><a href="http://curemetrex" target="_blank">CureMetrix</a></h3><figure id="f0b4"><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*9zopyOhMDE7R8PFvwQWOOQ.png" /></div></figure><p id="9bfc">Location: San Diego, USA</p><p id="99dc">Founded: 2014</p><p id="8e2f">CEO: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevindavidharris/" target="_blank">Kevin Harris</a></p><p id="7c30">Funding: Undisclosed Series A</p><p id="384c">Product: cmAssist (in development)</p><blockquote id="81b9">“Through its research partnerships with leading hospital radiology departments, CureMetrix has evaluated more than 500,000 mammogram images to identify potential false negatives, which are undiagnosed cancers, and false positives, which are unnecessary recalls of patients to review anomalies that turn out to be normal.”</blockquote><p id="acce">CureMetrix has a pilot partnership with Philips, UC San Diego and MD Anderson, and is developing a breast mammography CAD as an initial offering. It then hopes to extend this on a patented platform to other modalities, starting with CXR lung nodule detection. No word on regulatory status or product availability yet.</p><h3 id="dc6e"><a href="http://www.deepradiology.com/" target="_blank">Deep Radiology</a></h3><p id="aae0">NO LOGO FOUND</p><p id="c605">Location: Santa Monica, USA</p><p id="6d10">Founded: 2016</p><p id="1163">CEO: Unknown</p><p id="36b8">Funding: Undisclosed</p><p id="ec62">Product: Unknown</p><blockquote id="e0f2">“DeepRadiology, a deep learning artificial intelligence medical startup is proud to announce the world’s first fully autonomous system for medical image interpretation.

Then again, they are supported by <a href="https://twitter.com/drfeifei?lang=en" target="_blank">Professor Fei Fei Li</a>, a well-known researcher in the world of AI, and seem to have links to Stanford’s computer vision department.
