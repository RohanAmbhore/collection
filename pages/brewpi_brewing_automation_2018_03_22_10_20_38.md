This is usually done by hacking a fridge to install a heater inside and to give BrewPi control over the compressor.</p><p>Solid state relays (SSRs) are used to control 110V or 230V AC power to the heater and cooler with a small control signal from the BrewPi Spark.</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div>

It also runs the web interface so you can monitor and control your brew via your browser.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi connects to your home network and it is the central web server for BrewPi.</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div>
<div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img src="https://www.brewpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/system_overview-interface.png"   alt="system_overview-interface" /></div><div><div><div><h2>Computer, phone or tablet</h2><p>From any other device on your network, you can access the web page served by the Raspberry Pi.</p><p>On your BrewPi webpage, you can start and stop a brew, change your temperature profile, view charts and change settings.</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><h1>Build <strong>your </strong>brewery</h1><p>We think a big part of what makes brewing fun, is designing and building your awesome brewery.</p><p>Finding the right building blocks can be hard, but we got you covered. <br />
We put a lot of effort in finding high quality parts and if we cannot find them, we design them ourselves.</p><p>Our brewing setups are 'bring your own kettle'. You pick the kettles, we have the rest.<br />
Combine as you like, it's your party. <br />
Start small and expand later or go all out and automate everything right away. BrewPi will adapt to your needs.</p></div><div><div><div>

If you brew often, automating this process will save you a lot work.</p><p>We're building a new tool in which you can drag and drop parts to create a layout for your brewing setup, set up your brewing steps and apply them with one click. This will toggle your motorized valves, set temperatures and control pumps.</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div>

You can control multiple fermentations, kegs, mash, etc.</p></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><h3>

We’re getting really close to release now. Injection molded casing I hoped we could release tomorrow, but we were not 100% happy with the new enclosure after the first test run of the mold. Let me illustrate with some photos.   As you can…</p>

The 30cm coil was 11.5m long. Why? That’s what most home brewers were doing. But we recently started to suspect that such a long coil is not optimal. Sure, a longer coil will give you…</p>
