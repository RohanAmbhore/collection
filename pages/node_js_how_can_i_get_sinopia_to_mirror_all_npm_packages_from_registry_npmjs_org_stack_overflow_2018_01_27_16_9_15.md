<p>I'm working on setting up a complete npm repository in an offline environment, and I'm looking into using Sinopia as the repository.</p>

<p>Apparantly this has been done before. <a href="https://github.com/rlidwka/sinopia/issues/98" target="_blank">This thread</a> on the Sinopia github page describes a similar scenario, where you download all packages from registry.npmjs.org in an online environment before copying them to the offline environment, and a user even included a script to download all files to the Sinopia backend. The script seems to work, but it doesn't really download all packages - only all versions of packages already installed.</p>

<p>Is there some other way to tell Sinopia to download all pagkages from registry.npmjs.org, or can I somehow get a complete list of packages from registry.npmjs.org and use that to download all files to Sinopia?</p>

<p>Any input is appreciated!</p>
