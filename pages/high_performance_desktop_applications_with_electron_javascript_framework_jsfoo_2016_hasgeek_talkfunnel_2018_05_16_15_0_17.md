            <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>Electron is a javascript framework from Github, to build powerful cross platform desktop applications with HTML/JS/CSS. On top of electron, imagine applications developed with existing javascript ecosystem and building desktop apps - the outcome will be amazing. During this session, we will discuss in detail from a performance perspective, how we can analyze electron applications and how we can solve different challenges involved in it. With this stack, we can solve complex computation problems (data analytics, image processing) using javascript stack to achieve quicker load time and computation time. </p>
          <h2>Outline</h2>

          <h2>Speaker bio</h2>
            <p>I am Sairam Krish. I am a passionate developer for the past 12 years. I have been working on Electron based desktop applications and found it to be very impressive, in solving regular challenges with desktop applications. Also it bridges the gap between desktop and web applications. I like to share my actual work experience, findings and learning with the community. I have presented the same topic inside the company and response was amazing. Like to present it in JSFoo, since, we will have best Javascript audience. </p>
