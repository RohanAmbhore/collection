<p>I have a single directory that contains dozens of directories inside of it.</p>

<p>I'm new to command line and I'm struggling to come up with a command that will zip each sub-directory into a unique sub-directory.zip file.</p>

<p>So in the end my primary directory will be filled with all of my original sub-directories, plus the corresponding <code>.zip</code> files that contain the zipped up content of each sub-directory.</p>

<p>Is something like this possible? If so, please show me how it's done.</p>

<p>You can use this loop in <code>bash</code>:</p>

<pre><code>for i in */; do zip -r "${i%/}.zip" "$i"; done
</code></pre>

<p><code>i</code> is the name of the loop variable. <code>*/</code> means every subdirectory of the current directory, and will include a trailing slash in those names. Make sure you <code>cd</code> to the right place before executing this. <code>"$i"</code> simply names that directory, including trailing slash. The quotation marks ensure that whitespace in the directory name won't cause trouble. <code>${i%/}</code> is like <code>$i</code> but with the trailing slash removed, so you can use that to construct the name of the zip file.</p>

<p>If you want to see how this works, include an <code>echo</code> before the <code>zip</code> and you will see the commands printed instead of executed.</p>
