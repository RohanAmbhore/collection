<p>Even though I’d like to picture AI in healthcare as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmaJPV1okPo&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">friendly, marshmallowy robot</a>, this probably won’t happen (at least, not at first). Instead, AI in healthcare will be developed across multiple subsets of the healthcare industry, from drug discovery research and treatment optimizing plans all the way to being able to recognize cancerous tumors in various health screenings. </p>
<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking—<em>humans can already do all that, what makes a computer better at it than us</em>? Well, right now, AI isn’t necessarily better, but it’s like that extraordinarily gifted kid in school who everyone knows is headed for great things. With such promising potential, everyone in healthcare is keeping a close eye on AI and how it’ll be maximized in the coming years.</p>
<p>People are taking big bets on developing Artificial Intelligence in healthcare. Some are seeing early returns while others are still working towards their initial traction. </p>
