Well, Reacto is a <strong>suggestion to the react community</strong>. It is not in any way a replacement tool but more something that I wish could become an alternative for anyone out there.</p><h3 id="98a6">What does it do?</h3><figure id="8616"><div><div><img src="https://i.embed.ly/1/display/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F3NtE6j0xZCbVlbVPai%2Fgiphy.gif&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&width=40" /></div></figure><p id="1dda"><strong>It lets you interact with your code,</strong> in a very intuitive way. What I called “bricks” will help you to quickly add props to your components, bind component methods in a flash, manage imports and let you convert any class-based component to a pure component and vice versa, in one click.</p><figure id="a50e"><div><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/66/1*jbjwu7cX4TMxa73bKk3Qig.png?q=20" /><div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1320/1*jbjwu7cX4TMxa73bKk3Qig.png" /></div><figcaption>Integrated package manager</figcaption></figure><p id="5e75"><strong>It lets you simply interact with your dependencies.</strong> Add multiple packages, delete or upgrade, without leaving your code editor. Every task will run concurrently along the others. You can also get suggestions from npm registry right from Reacto.</p><p id="55d1"><strong>Get smart local autocomplete.</strong> Automatically find the relative path to local modules, no matter its location in the current file tree. Simply type the filename you need to import and Reacto will take care of everything else. Also take advantage of integrated React snippets, such as “skeleton”, “constructor” and more. No need to install any additional plugin, it’s just there already.</p><p id="499d"><strong>Preview component (WIP).</strong> Hit <code>Cmd+R</code> and get an instant preview of your component. Start creating new class-based react components now, and see how it looks anytime you’ll edit the file.</p><p id="95a5">Reacto still need a lot of work to become greater, and this is why I am sharing it today with all of you. I wish that many developers will join, bring feedback, ideas, time and become part of this initiative. No matter how good you are, any help will certainly be appreciated.</p><p id="81d0">I have started developing when I was just a kid. For years, I have learned, getting help from the community so I could bring my ideas to life.</p><p id="ea64">Today, I really hope that I can give something back to all of you, so that new developers start programming with the right tools, for free.</p><p id="211e">Thank you for your time, and <a href="https://github.com/eveningkid/reacto" target="_blank">do give it a try</a>.
