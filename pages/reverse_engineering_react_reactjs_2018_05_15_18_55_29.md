<p>Still has plenty of merit but if you're aiming for a Dan Abramov redux style reimplementation it doesn't really work for me but then React is so much bigger it's never really going to be possible.</p>

<p>Thanks, appreciate that.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you're driving at here. The source code is my interpretation of React, if you will, a result of my understanding. In that sense, it is "how things work", at least as far as I see it. Also, I'd suggest if I may trying it out for yourself so that you can really see that it works. That's what got me excited.</p>

<p>Agreed. React is so much bigger. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how little code was required. If I was aiming at anything in the end, it was to show that. And to show React's elegance. There's something about it. It's a piece of engineering that deserves more than a casual look, I'm sure you'll agree!</p>

<p>Thanks again for the comments!</p>

These videos (admittedly I haven't watched them all) just show your solution with an explanation.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to put it together, I'm sure people will find it useful - it's just not for me.</p>

I think it's a really interesting topic and React codebase is quite inspiring in terms of patterns and implementation (React uses patterns more viable in game industry for example). I also chosen to take this journey and the result of it are two blogposts. One explains step by step what happens after you call <code>setState</code> in your React component and the second one explains one interesting pattern of Transactions which is used in lots of places in the codebase. Be sure to check them out!</p>
