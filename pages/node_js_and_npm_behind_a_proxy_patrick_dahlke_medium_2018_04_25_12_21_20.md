I thought that the web proxy settings would be like the rest of the unix world and require me to set the <code>HTTP_PROXY</code> and <code>HTTPS_PROXY</code> environment variables. Although I just cloned the Node repository from <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node" target="_blank">Github</a> so they are already setup. What gives?</p><p id="b0fa">A little searching and I discover that <code>npm</code> uses a configuration file and it can be added to via the command line <code>npm config set ...</code>. The key to getting it right is the spelling of the settings. This has bit me so many times now! Getting <code>npm</code> to work behind a proxy requires setting the <code>proxy</code> and <code>https-proxy</code> settings. The key is noticing the <code>-</code> (dash) is not an <code>_</code> (underscore).</p><p id="b117">So the full procedure is install <a href="http://nodejs.com/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> via the installer or source.<br />Open an command prompt or terminal session and run the following commands to configure <code>npm</code> to work with your web proxy. The commands use <code>proxy.company.com</code> as the address and <code>8080</code> as the port.</p><pre id="fd79"><code>npm config set proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080<br />npm config set https-proxy <a href="http://proxy.company.com:8080" target="_blank">http://proxy.company.com:8080</a></code></pre><p id="4d83">Why the developers of <code>npm</code> choose to use a dash instead of an underscore like the rest of the unix work is beyond me. Maybe someone will add in an alias so setting <code>https_proxy</code> will have the same effect as <code>https-proxy</code>.</p>
