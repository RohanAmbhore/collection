		<p><a href="http://alfredapp.com/" target="_blank">Alfred 2.0</a> has been written from the ground up and is a vast improvement on the original. As well as a number of other changes, the new Workflows are now more powerful than previous Alfred Extensions. However, old extensions are no longer supported and must be re-written to work with the new system.</p>
<p>I'll be releasing a number of new Alfred Workflows in the near future, but I've started by re-writing the Create New File extension I <a href="http://ianisted.co.uk/new-file-for-alfred-2" target="_blank">released last year</a>. Once again I'd like to thank <a href="http://ianisted.co.uk/new-file-for-alfred#comment-497773014" target="_blank">Chris Kalafarski (farski)</a> for improving the first ever version of my script. Thanks to George for adding a critical update to prevent overwriting existing files.Â </p>

		<p>How to use this Workflow</p>
<p>For help please <a href="http://ianisted.co.uk/new-file-for-alfred-2#how-to" target="_blank">click here</a>. I'll update this help page specifically for the new Workflow soon.</p>
<p>I have also added a hotkey option. You can specify the hotkey from your Alfred Workflow window (I find CTRL + ALT + N works quite nicely).</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments please let me know, and I'll be happy to help.</p>
