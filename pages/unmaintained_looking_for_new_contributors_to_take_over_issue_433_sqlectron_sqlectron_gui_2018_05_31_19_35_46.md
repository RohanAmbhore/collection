          <p>I guess I have not been using SQL databases for the last 2 years, which means no Sqlectron as well. I tried to maintain this project as much as I could but I have lost the interest spending my personal time on something I don‚Äôt use anymore. That is why I'm formally pausing my work on its maintenance <g-emoji>üò¢</g-emoji></p>
<p>If you use it and you are interested in keeping this project alive. Please, contact me over here and I will make sure to help you out with anything you need for a smooth maintainer transition.</p>
<p>Overall, thanks to all users and contributors <g-emoji>‚ù§Ô∏è</g-emoji></p>

          <p>Max, thanks again for all the help and advices you gave to us, contributors. I completely understand you've lost interest maintaining something that you don't use. I can relate to that <g-emoji>üòÖ</g-emoji></p>
<p>I'd just like to point out to future maintainer, that UI code may use some good refactoring. Max is world class engineer, but I think lot of contributions to GUI repo were from people (including myself) that were getting started with React couple of years ago. I think the same was with Max, it was learn-new-technology-make-something-useful kind of project, if I'm not wrong :) Backend part should be good, Max got that covered well.</p>
<p>All in all, what was supposed to be learn&fun project turned into something really useful and that's true beauty of open source. I know people will mostly see the value in the app they use (<em>Sqlectron</em>), but there's additional value to that. Max helped me, and many others, to get started with Open Source, and technologies there were new to us. Speaking on my behalf, he was very patient teacher and OSS maintainer. I've never felt a bit of annoyance in his replies, no matter how dull my question was. That guy is true Open Source Hero if you ask me. <a href="https://github.com/github" target="_blank">@github</a> you hear me? :D</p>
<p>Ps. For future maintainer(s): Maybe you could use Open Collective platform for covering part of your expenses?</p>

          <p>I would love to be a part of Sqlectron's future, but would definitely want to be working with a few others.</p>
<p>I came to Sqlectron just today while looking for a good relational database GUI that isn't absolute trash on Linux. Not only is it good, it's really good. I don't have time to be the sole maintainer of it, but if there are at least a couple others that would like to spend some time making this project even more awesome I would love to be a part of it.</p>

          <p>I was contacted by mahongquan weeks ago. But I didn't agree with the way the changes were driven on his fork (mostly commit messages and the way changes were done). I spent a long time building this app and I hope to pass the ownership to someone who shares few common guides:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep the commit history clean, so it makes easier for contributors to maintain the project (a great article about that: <a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/" target="_blank">https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/</a>)</li>
<li>keep the master branch clean, do not commit debugging stuff that should live a separated development branch</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't want to be picky. I'm just thinking about the future of the project to keep it easy for other contributors to join and understand the project history and codebase.</p>
