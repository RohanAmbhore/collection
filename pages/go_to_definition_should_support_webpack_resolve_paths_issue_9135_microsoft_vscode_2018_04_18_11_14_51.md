          <p>Currently Go To Definition works perfectly well for relative paths within application, eg:</p>
<pre><code>import something from './something'
</code></pre>
<p>However, after I add some resolve paths in Webpack config, like</p>
<pre><code>  resolve: {
    root: [
      path.resolve(rootPath, 'app/frontend/lib'),
</code></pre>
<p>I can import files like this</p>
<pre><code>import something from 'something'
// instead of 
// import something from 'app/frontend/lib/something' or
// import something from '../../lib/something'
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that VSCode won't follow these resolve paths.</p>
<p>The solution could be to add configuration which will define additional resolve paths for Go To Definition functionality.</p>
