A deluxe piece of technology to be sure, but it also has 73 buttons on the remote.</p><p id="6db8">Sometimes you just need a play button.</p><p id="03f7">So, I decided to strip React Router out of one of my sites and implement something that was tailor made.</p><p id="0fe1">What you will find below is certainly nothing revolutionary, and if you’re an expert, there’s probably nothing in this post for you. But the adventure was a success and I found the process interesting.</p><p id="2877">Maybe it will be interesting to you too.</p><h3 id="c57e">Sweetening the pot</h3><p id="732a">Although I didn’t start this with the aim of improving performance, there was a rather staggering 20% drop in load time.</p><figure id="99e6"><div><div><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/90/1*p2ljKftqaWKSqVyhcrPYbw.png?q=20" /><div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*p2ljKftqaWKSqVyhcrPYbw.png" /></div></figure><p id="c628">The package size dropped by 13% from 104 KB gzipped to 90 KB, so I would have expected a drop in download/parse time of about the same. I’m honestly not sure where the other 7% improvement came from, but I’ll take it.</p></section><section><div><div><p id="1640">Let’s get into it.</p><h3 id="0894">Step 0: Requirements gathering</h3><p id="4760">My requirements are actually pretty simple:</p><ul><li id="de4f">Based on the URL, render a particular page (represented by a component)</li><li id="c0f4">When the user clicks a link, update the URL (without a full page refresh)</li><li id="a63b">When the URL updates, update the page</li></ul><h3 id="cf60">Step 1: Selecting a page based on the URL</h3><p id="1af1">The component below takes a URL (actually just the pathname part) as a prop, maps that to a component, and renders it.

And I can’t define actions here to assign to each route. And it’s in the same module as the <code>&lt;App&gt;</code> component, so can’t be used elsewhere.</p><p id="467f">Should I arrange it now so that I can more easily add these features later if I want? Isn’t that good, future-proof code?</p><p id="956b">The correct question is: “will it be <em>harder </em>to do that in the future than it is to do today?” The answer is quite obviously no, so for today at least, my code will not be more complex that it needs to be.</p></section><section><div><div><p id="b3ef">Next up, I need to pass in the current pathname to this component, on both the server and in the browser.</p><h3 id="face">Step 2: Server-side rendering</h3><p id="81ea">I’m using <code>express</code> on the server, so pathname is available in <code>req.url</code>, which means I can render the page like so:</p><figure id="11e4"><div><div><img src="https://i.embed.ly/1/display/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Favatars2.githubusercontent.com%2Fu%2F4443482%3Fv%3D3%26s%3D400&key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd&width=40" /></div></figure><p id="f42f">Really, that’s the whole thing. I hadn’t thought about this part until I got to it, and was quite pleased by how simple it was. (In a more serious environment I’d handle 404s with a <code>res.status(404)</code> here.)</p></section><section><div><div><p id="4eab">Okey dokey, that’s big bad server-side-rendering out of the way, on to …</p><h3 id="d9b3">Step 3: Client-side rendering</h3><figure id="f22a"><div><div><img src="https://i.embed.ly/1/display/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Favatars2.githubusercontent.com%2Fu%2F4443482%3Fv%3D3%26s%3D400&key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd&width=40" /></div></figure><p id="0a21">Boom. Because <code>location.pathname</code> in the browser matches <code>req.url</code> on the server, everything just works.</p></section><section><div><div><p id="1569">At this point, the app is working for any given route and is pleasingly simple. Now I just need to be able to update that route in the browser …</p><h3 id="6bfa">Step 4: Updating the URL</h3><p id="a8a9">There are two approaches to this particular step:</p><ol><li id="4337">Update the URL in one place. That is, treat <code>document.location</code> as the ‘state’ that holds the current route. Then listen for changes in <code>document.location</code> to update the page.</li><li id="dd63">Update the URL in two places. That is, store the ‘current route’ in an actual store and update both the URL and the store at the same time. No need to listen for changes to <code>document.location</code>.</li></ol><p id="be4f">Number two means either passing some <code>updateRoute()</code> method in to every <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> or using React’s context. I dont know about you, but I have never used React’s context for something and not regretted it later (sage advice from Facebook: “If you want your application to be stable, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html" target="_blank">don’t use context</a>.”).</p><p id="cef6">So, #1 it is.</p><p id="fe7a">I just need a component that updates the URL when a link is clicked. (Although not for external links, nor for links where the user wants a new tab.)</p><figure id="0dea"><div><div><img src="https://i.embed.ly/1/display/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Favatars2.githubusercontent.com%2Fu%2F4443482%3Fv%3D3%26s%3D400&key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd&width=40" /></div></figure><p id="c686">I’ll tell you all about <code>history.push()</code> in the next section.</p><p id="3a86">I can now use a link like: <code>&lt;Link href="/about"&gt;About&lt;/Link&gt;</code> and trust that it will update the URL to <code>/about</code> when clicked.</p></section><section><div><div><p id="580a">Bonus tip: always use a <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component instead of anchor tags directly.

The module looked like this:</p><figure id="54c7"><div><div><img src="https://i.embed.ly/1/display/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Favatars2.githubusercontent.com%2Fu%2F4443482%3Fv%3D3%26s%3D400&key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd&width=40" /></div></figure><p id="c4dc">But hang on, if I need a module to wrap the history package so that I’m using the same instance, that means that under the hood they’re probably just registering event listeners so that when I call <code>push()</code>, they call the callbacks registered with <code>listen</code>.</p><p id="660f">Well shucks, I can do that myself.</p><figure id="4eda"><div><div><img src="https://i.embed.ly/1/display/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Favatars2.githubusercontent.com%2Fu%2F4443482%3Fv%3D3%26s%3D400&key=4fce0568f2ce49e8b54624ef71a8a5bd&width=40" /></div></figure><p id="e2e2">There we go, saved myself 2.5 KB.</p></section><section><div><div><h4 id="bc25"><strong>A brief performance intermission</strong></h4><p id="adce">You might think getting excited over 2.5 KB is silly, but the load time dropped by a decent 15%.</p><p id="36c5"><em>Fifteen</em> percent.</p><p id="588d">I’ll bet neither of us would have predicted that adding a little tiny package would add so much to the load time.</p><p id="da8d">This is why I highly recommend keeping a spreadsheet handy to record these sorts of things.
