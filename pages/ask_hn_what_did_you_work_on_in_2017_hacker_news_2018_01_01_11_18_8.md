                  I quit what many would consider a successfull job in programming and had a sabbatical year. Moved to a smaller town and down sized everything in spending to the point where I pay $600 per month for housing, food and bills, so living of my savings haven't been an issue at all.<p>I have focused on things like reading (read +40 books in 2017, up from 1-2 per year), wood working, sketching, running and skiing. To keep up my programming skills I have done a deep dive in new programming languages and fiddling with some side projects. It has been an <i>incredible</i> year for personal development and it has changed my perspective on what things are important in life (sitting in front of a screen 40-60 hours a week not being one of them). I highly recommend everyone to do this at least once in your career!

                  Not really. My girlfriend and I together make more than 200k/y and spend less than 1k/month on expenses while we prepare for her to launch a business. We cook food from CSA and our Farmer's market, have a cozy 2 bedroom in a quiet city and generally just don't buy a lot of things we don't need.

                  I quit my job as a software engineer at Google early this year to teach people how to code. I started paying people $15/hr to learn so they can make ends meet while learning instead of working at Walmart.<p>I thought about all the missing pieces in my engineering growth and created a curriculum that welcomes students from 0 engineering background and plugs in all the holes that were black boxed to me in my engineering growth: We host our own servers, allowing students configure nginx and create ssl certs themselves for the apps they build. Our projects mimick existing well known companies (netflix, dropbox, gmail, google docs clones).</p><p>Our curriculum is largely project based, so students work together on projects that they would be using themselves: building their own email client, chat client, filestorage/backups, firebase, etc. From day 1 of a students journey, their code is thoroughly code reviewed by other students.</p><p>2 months ago, Calworks, a local government assistance program, offered to send students to us and pay each students $13/hr for up to 6 months. Unfortunately, to make this deal work, we needed a commercial office (my wife and I teach out of our apartment) and we did not have the financial resources.</p><p>Last month, we finally got approved as a tax exempt non-profit so I can reach out to my friends for donations (but donations take time, I have to set up a bunch of fundraising tools first). My savings ran out so I started applying for jobs and landed a full-time position at Paypal starting in January.</p><p>Moving forward into 2018, a few of the senior students are going to be leading the non profit. 100% of my salary and equity is going into the non-profit so existing students would not only continue to be paid, but we now also have the financial resources to get an office and push the Calworks deal through to help more people! 2018 is looking to be a great year.</p><p>We do not have any internet presence at the moment because this year our focus had largely been testing and iterating our curriculum as well as our financial model. 2018 will be different and if you want to help, our non-profit is called GarageScript.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/garagescript/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/garagescript/</a>

                  This is absolutely awesome. Sounds like a really great way to make the world a better place.<p>Not everybody is using fb, I hope you'll finish your <a href="http://garagescript.org/" target="_blank">http://garagescript.org/</a> website soon because now most links don't seem to be working. When you provide more details I think you may find some people who are willing to donate. E.g. is non-profit registered under garagescript? I couldn't find it. Well at least make contact and linkedin links working now that you are going to get some exposure from HN frontpage.</p><p>Got a bit too much into details, but what I meant to say, really great initiative, kudos.

                  Responded, I think donating time is the best form of donation. Students want mentorship from industry veterans but its hard to find people willing to commit the time to mentor. Thank you for offering!

                  1. I was genuinely sharing what I did this year, was not hoping for any positive financial outcomes.<p>2. Integration with non-profits donations is not trivial. After registering as a non-profit, it takes some time for the list of registered non-profits to propagate through to donation tools (facebook, gofundme, etc). Sometimes, I have to fax in documents to prove legitimacy, and it takes a few days for that to process. I could easily create a gofundme for "help me do x" in my name instead of the non-profit's, but I didn't want to do that.</p><p>Hope that clears things up.

                  From all of the research I've read, autism seems to be a neurological disorder. Is this not the case? Genuinely curious what led you down this road rather than others as I've been struggling to reason about similar issues and tendencies I've had.

                  What I am trying to do is change the contour of my forehead muscles so they don't feel as intense.  The forehead muscle has nerves, so it is part of the nervous system.<p>What led me down this road is I found a study that said that people on the spectrum may have different facial features (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-with-autism-have-distinct-facial-features-study/" target="_blank">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-with-autism-have-disti...</a>).  I reasoned my face looks very similar, and then realized that I experienced lots of muscle tension on my forehead.

                  This sounds cool! You seem high functioning. I know someone who's low functioning, about grade 2-3 mentality and can't keep conversations going for long. No savant level skills either. How does your work affect people on that end of the spectrum? Do you see any of your work applying to them? Sorry if you've answered any of this in your research. I'll check your site out more tomorrow.

                  It will have little to no impact on low-functioning autism, unfortunately :(.  Researching low functioning autism is far more complicated than the type of research I am doing.<p>BTW, I am diagnosed as high-functioning, but I am not so high-functioning that I can "pass" for normal or even close to normal in public.  That is starting to change though.

The external link was only to source one of the images, so I'm not sure if I should bother replacing it.<p>I actually know quite a lot about math and science, but my major difficulty is not being able to hold down a career where I have to apply math/science (though I have difficulty staying focused at most jobs that require substantial abstract ability).</p><p>In addition to Hooke's law, I simply felt a lot of muscle tension on my forehead growing up.  Because I essentially had that feeling from birth though, I didn't consciously notice it until recently.

                  At the end of 2016 I left contracting gig for a full time position to work on helping solve intermittency problem with solar PV power generation through forecasting.<p>With a team of 3 including myself, the only professional software developer, we have launched and run a solar radiation and PV power forecasting/observation API (solcast.com.au) that can provide solar radiation and PV power forecasts world wide that update every 10-30 minutes based on satellite coverage.</p><p>For the past 10 months this API has been freely accessible whilst we validated our approach and expanded to cover the globe. After great feedback from users, we are now planning a big update to make it even easier to use and to integrate live PV output data into forecasting itself.</p><p>The change to work on something that contributes a large net positively to society’s around the world (making solar based electricity generation more financially attractive to operators/home owners a like all over the world) has been hugely rewarding and look forward to the growth of solar power generation in 2018.

                  That’s not quite true. There are still illegal reasons for firing (discrimination, retaliation for whistleblowing, etc) though fighting back can be difficult and costly.
But if you’re okay with the current state of affairs (I was with my own previous incident - the company was awful) it can make sense to just move on.

                  In the US this would be 100% legal. For almost all jobs, you can fire someone for any reason (I don't like your shirt, your jokes weren't funny, it's a Tuesday) or literally no reason at all. The exceptions are few and far between - unions provide additional protection via collective bargaining agreements; you can't fire someone for being in a protected class (i.e. because of their race or gender); and you can't fire someone in retaliation for something like a wage complaint. You could almost certainly fire someone for making a video you don't like (unless they're in a union, which is very few tech employees.)

                  Quitting my full-time job to pursue my side-projects was the best thing I could have done for my health and sanity this year.<p>I am now working on a bunch of ideas that I hope will help some people around here:</p><p>1. A Pocket-to-Kindle service that syncs (almost) instantly to your Kindle whatever article you save, formats it like a professionally edited book, cleans up ads and takes advantage of the new typesetting engine inside the new Kindle firmware.</p><p>2. A Spotify music discovery website. 
I'm trying to make a two-click-playlist-generator by using Spotify APIs to look at the top artists/genres of a user and create playlists on the fly with tracks that the user could like.</p><p>I use Spotify daily and found myself overwhelmed by how much music there is available. Because of that, I'm mostly listening to my saved songs, Discover Weekly/Release Radar and trying out playlists that usually have the same too popular songs.</p><p>3. An adaptive brightness/contrast app for external monitors. Adjusting brightness using the monitor's controls is always annoying to do.</p><p>4. A morning alarm that starts playing an algorithmically generated Spotify playlist each time, with fade-up volume, external speaker support, adaptive algorithm based on likes/dislikes and self-updating alarm times based on day moments (twilight, sunrise, golden hour, dusk etc.)</p><p>5. A detector for processes that eat up all your CPU and battery. I started writing this in Rust so I can make it cross-platform and learn the language at a lower level.

                  Ad 1. I am really interested of about the progress of development of your service. I would love to see it as "Show HN" submission.<p>Personally, I am thinking about developing an online service, which will be offerring general-purpose providing distribution of content to Kindle or other ebook-readers. Initially, I thought about creating only a app which will extract a article tag from website and create ebook from it (pandoc) or exactly a Pocket-to-Kindle. But when I was thinking more about it more ideas had come to my mind, HN-frontpage scrapper, simple notebook/orgmode adapted to Kindle Experimental Browser, markdown-files-to-ebook, arxiv-to-ebook converter, some kind of IFFTT pipeline (stream X from Y and save it as a ebook) and even trying to implement most of features known from Calibre application... If I could somehow help you as a developer or you are interested in bootstrapping some online service together I really would like to receive an e-mail from you. My e-mail address: (put my HN nickname here) at gmail.com

                  I just recently joined Spotify. I have found their "we will play similar music after your music ends" feature to enable me to discover lots of new artists. I find it interesting you found Spotify lacking here, because I am finding the opposite.

                  I'm a long time Spotify user. I love that feature too and it worked very well for me when it first launched. But after a while it started playing the same songs that I have already heard many times. Spotify's algorithm is very unpredictable so I can't say it will work out the same for you. But if it will, at least you can have another try with what I'm trying to build ^_^

                  I would consider offering Instapaper as well as Pocket. I generally find Instapaper does a better job overall.<p>The number of times Pocket just either redirects to the original article, or drops salient bits of text (in particular, unordered list items) is really annoying.

                  It already works with Instapaper too, I just explain  it as a Pocket to Kindle service because that's what people use the most these days.<p>Personally I use Instapaper more for reading because of all the premium features being free and keep Pocket in sync using IFTTT for their good recommendations.

                  I don't have any other source of income. I had a pretty good paying job for the past year and managed to save one year worth of savings. I can survive with what I have until June (I think).  I'm doing my best to create something that helps at least a few people, and maybe get some money from that too. 
Even if I don't, I have already learned and practiced so much more skills than I could if I had a full time job and that makes it worth it.

                  Yes, I've used it for a few months. That's the reason I've started working on my thing. I felt that it didn't have the features that I needed the most (hyphenation, dropcaps, ad removal etc.) and I would have felt like a jerk to ask for these things from the developer.

Think of it like reddit, but chatrooms insteads of forums. I just deployed the first version a few hours ago. Bored Hackers is an experiment at building the community site that I wish existed : public chatroom based communites, pseudonymous users, transparent moderation logs, an open source code base and a site that is welcoming to non-technical users. Currently, there is a single chat room for all discussions and support for user created chat rooms will be added shortly.

                  It’s definitely a factor to be aware of. We are legally not allowed to be exposed to image content, as developers, but personally I do have some exposure to text content as part of my role. Thorn has an excellent support / wellness system, with professional counselors, in place though for proactively staying healthy and processing what exposure we do experience.

                  I’m very glad they have such a good support network. A close friend of mine got a job out of law school prosecuting child sex crimes, and there was absolutely no support. After a year, he couldn’t take it any more and left public service altogether. Even a decade later, you can tell he’s still bothered by it. I have an incredible amount of respect for people who can do that work; I’m absolutely certain that I don’t have what it takes.

                  Definitely, I think support is crucial. I work around people who have victim ID experience (reviewing abuse material with the goal of locating children) and strongly share your respect. It’s so impactful in the lives of the victims, but you are exposed to a very dark side of humanity and are unlikely to know the eventual outcomes of the children’s lives.

                  It’s a small team, so as a developer I’m not working “on content”, but definitely working “around” it if that makes sense. It’s not as bad as it could be, but I’d say somebody should at least be aware of the potential and take it seriously, for personal wellness sake.

                  I made (Let's) All Mine, a site that I hoped would pay for a master's degree in statistics. The idea was inspired by The Million Dollar Homepage [2] which was an experiment in what qualifies as a website. Essentially, that site took people's annoyance by ads, and made a site that was <i>entirely</i> ads, a 1000x1000 pixel grid where each square pixel cost $1. And it was successful.<p>My project takes people's annoyance by browser miners, and is a site whose entire purpose is browser mining. There's nothing else to it. The goal is to mine 1,000 Monero (an altcoin) collaboratively. After taxes and fees, that would cover the approximate cost of 2 years in grad school. I did the math the other day and realized that with about 1 million miners, I could achieve this task in 1 week (or 1 day with 7.5M miners, or 1 month with 250k people).</p><p>But I've had very little luck promoting it. It's a tough sell, and while I'd love for the internet's capricious eye to smile on me and make it take off, I'm not optimistic. Nevertheless, it was a fun learning project!</p><p>[1] <a href="https://allmine.io" target="_blank">https://allmine.io</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage</a>

The final result was ok, unfortunately dating market is already saturated, and our market is only limited to London, lesson learned, test your idea first, build a quick prototype, don't spend more than 5-6 months, unless you are really sure.</p><p>For the rest of the year, I have concentrated in learning Reactive functional programming, created a small backend app with Clojure, at work I am working on  iOS app, which I have architected using, RxSwift, MVVM, it has over 650 tests, with close to 80% test coverage using Quick and Nimble frameworks.

                  1) is so great -- thanks for making/sharing. I run into the clunky search process for 10k's once in a while and think your site does a great job improving that experience.<p>In case you're taking feature requests, these are some things I'd love to see in a 10k site  (order in relevancy):</p><pre><code>  autocomplete in search
  see recently released 10k's
  browse functionality
  10k specific discussions (e.g., annotating similar to RapGenius as well as longform analysis)
</code></pre>
Some/all those may not be relevant for your site, just things I've always thought would be cool to see. And again, nice job with the site!

I had been working on it for 2 years, but in 2017 we separated it from the rest of the codebase and made it open source.<p>Even though feature engineering is crucial for building machine learning pipelines, there are few formal methods for performing feature engineering. We see Featuretools filling a missing component in the software engineering stack for data science.</p><p>It has already been put to the test with our customers at my company, but we have also begun to release demos so that others can pick it up <a href="https://www.featuretools.com/demos" target="_blank">https://www.featuretools.com/demos</a>.

(btw Slack has been awesome regarding the transition)</p><p>- And plenty more I intend to write about in a "year in review" post I'm working on.</p><p>Becoming a founder this year was one of the most challenging, fascinating, and deeply rewarding experiences I've ever had.</p><p>Here's to a happy, healthy, productive, and successful 2018</p><p>Happy New Year HN!

                  I was excited about this project when i first saw it here but i have to say the setup instructions are very confusing. It would be nice if the documentation had step by step installation and first boot instructions. Many months after cloning the repo, i have never managed to set it up.<p>The instructions are all over the place. The NodeJS instructions say you can run npm -i after installing node. Then you get to Getting Started and it seems like a detached process altogether. The getting started section should start from either installing the dependencies or  cloning the repo. Right now it just starts with renaming some file.</p><p>Good work, though, at least from what i can see on the site once it actually does run it is a beautiful thing.

                  Started working on my first side project! It's an alternative way to screen developers that I think is better than anything that's currently out there. I'm interested in hearing feedback on the idea.<p>You provide JSON data that will be exposed through an API which candidates will use. They are given instructions on how to parse and manipulate the data. Then they POST the response to you. If the response is 200 OK - they've passed and they can upload their code for your team to review and decide if they should go to the interview stage.</p><p>I think this has lots of benefits:</p><p>- It's gives candidates a real-life problem to solve. Most, if not all software developers will have to interact with API's and manipulate data.</p><p>- Candidates can use their own dev environment that they are comfortable using.</p><p>- It saves the company time. They can choose to only assess the code of people who pass the test.</p><p>- It makes for a good candidate experience. I think it reflects well on a company if their interview process is close to real-life work.</p><p>Hoping to ship the beta version of this next month

                  This approach shifts the effort on constantly changing the source JSON data and specification on how it needs to finally look to the client. Lazy devs will inevitably post solutions online.<p>This approach also requires the client to implement ratelimiting, but you could fix that by having the data POSTed to your servers instead.</p><p>I unfortunately can't remember the name of it, but a service was presented on here a while ago that presented a series of security challenges then connected successful applicants with employers and managed the whole process. Methinks that's the right way to do this kind of thing.

                  I nearly ended up a pancake when my steering failed heading into a turn in February, the day before my birthday. I realized the circumstances that led to me not being able to fix it before it led to near disaster weren't going to change on the path I was heading down largely by habit, so I finally set some priorities.<p>I decided to focus on making a business out of music. I'm far from where I want to be, but it's been a long time since I was doing Mechanical Turk tasks to pay for junk food. I have savings, my music is improving, and 4 people pay me almost $15 a month through Patreon[1]. Probably not a lot to the crowd here at HN, but it's a peace of mind I never knew before.</p><p>The big, super-important lesson I got from that is to not cling to what I wanted at some point in the past and accept how things are. I wanted to be fully financially independent, but had no plans, no goals, no notion of how I might make it happen. I had the desire, but not the will or commitment.</p><p>Being two seconds and one failure of attention from the front end of an 18-wheeler has a way of hitting the reset button.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalscofflaw" target="_blank">https://www.patreon.com/digitalscofflaw</a>

                  I remember seeing this last year too, I like it. This is a good reminder for me to try using it in side projects.<p>I fear though that you're swimming against the currents (obviously, speaking about the current trends of everyone using React or one of the other frameworks for frontend development). I hope you'll gain traction in creating a trend of a different path, making traditional web development style a viable alternative for modern web apps.

Ask personally and select people with different backgrounds. Let people speak and just listen.</p><p>I plan to summarize it in an article in 2018. It has been fun to compare this to the current Gartner's Hype Cycle* for example.

                  When I ask people about the future of tech, most of them just end up listing their wish list. I wish in future we can do XYZ... Or they end up talking about human accomplishments (space, medical etc.) that they most likely don't get to partake in closely.<p>So last week I asked a bunch of people (techies and non-techies alike) what current tech they regularly use that they couldn't have imagined 10 years ago. Got some really interesting thoughts. Retina displays and 4k displays were definitely unexpected. Complete phone backup to cloud would've surprised many. Same with mostly waterproof phones.</p><p>One trend I noticed that people are way more surprised with hardware than software, even though AI/ML software has made huge leaps in the last decade. Maybe because sci-fi has raised our expectations for human-life AI and until we achieve that in code, it just won't be enough. But hardware innovations continue to amaze people.

                  My wife and I worked remotely (~4 days a week) and we traveled the world. South east Asia, Europe, US and back via Asia to end the year home in Australia. It was an awesome year, saw some incredible places and also got to work on some interesting Dev projects. I had a chance to get a few open source PRs through to a Python CMS and towards the end of the year got invited to join the core development team. Getting more involved with open source has been lots of fun, seeing how bigger teams work together and also actually contributing some complex (for me) fixes has been great.<p>Fixed: Spelling

                  I made the leap and partnered up full time with a friend & former coworker on his indie game "Clone Drone in the Danger Zone", a third-person laser-sword-fighter where any part of your body can be sliced off.<p>We released on Steam[1] Early Access in March, which was a special moment to be a part of (I grew up as a kid playing games on Steam, the process behind game creation used to be a mysterious fascination!)</p><p>In 2017 we built and released a ton of fun updates -- a Steam Workshop integration, Twitch Mode & Twitch Extension (where chatters can spawn enemies), and a super ambitious chapter 3 that added AI allies and a multi-part tower-assault adventure with fun scripted/animated moments.</p><p>Coming up next we tackle multiplayer. To do that, we first spent a month "burning a pancake" by making a small free multiplayer game called "Long Live Santa!" [2]. Within 3 days, more players had installed that game than the game we'd spent over a year on... it just hit over 100,000 players, just over a couple weeks after its initial release. We were surprised to see the momentum that releasing something for free generates.</p><p>It's been a lot of challenging, varied work, with more autonomy and skin in the game than any previous role and I absolutely love it.</p><p>Going in to next year we are going full force on adding multiplayer to Clone Drone, using the lessons learned from Long Live Santa to guide us. (& if you've made a multiplayer game before, would love to chat some time and swap notes!)</p><p>[1]: <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/597170/" target="_blank">http://store.steampowered.com/app/597170/</a></p><p>[2]: <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/763410/Long_Live_Santa/" target="_blank">http://store.steampowered.com/app/763410/Long_Live_Santa/</a>

                  At my day job (dev consulting), I worked the entire year on a project that our client ultimately decided to shelve, which allowed me to level up my Ember.js, Rails, and Postgres.<p>On the volunteer front, I ran a computer club at my daughter's middle school for 20 sessions of 2 hours each, teaching kids some basic JavaScript, and taking them on a tour of things like turtle graphics, L-systems, rotoscoping, and a wrote them a simple "get the coins, don't touch the lava" game engine and a text-based level designer for it.</p><p>I also took a two week gig for Girls Who Code to run one of their campus summer programs at the University of Minnesota. We used Scratch to cover basic programming concepts, and in the second week they split into teams, each team working on a socially progressive game. One of the teams wrote a two player platformer that had a male and female character. The man had fewer hazards, and picked up money, and the woman had more hazards and picked up hearts. The levels were passed by the man and woman both flipping gender-specific switches. On the last level, the woman character doesn't appear, and the man can't complete all the tasks. Genius, and from a group of middle school kids.

It all started as a for fun project while freelancing and turned into a profitable business. All while still being a lot of fun to work on. Unlike other Pi based solutions, info-beamer isn't using a sluggish browser but uses Lua/C at its core to use all the hardware acceleration features while still being pretty simple to program (see <a href="https://info-beamer.com/doc/info-beamer" target="_blank">https://info-beamer.com/doc/info-beamer</a>). The challenge is always to make all those feature easily available through a web interface. I'm currently improving that a lot by enabling users to create more complicated output without any programming knowledge. Getting to know Vue.js has helped a lot with that.

                  I let a close friend recruit me, after over a year of trying, and have been working on a new project that took on a life of its own. I've been more productive and happy in the past few months than I have been in years. 2017 was the best year ever. Before that, so was 2016, etc., every year better than the last. 2018, I'm sure, will be another new all-time high.

                  I spent most of 2017 reflecting on the direction programming/languages/communities are going and finding ways to move the needle the other way. It seems to me that there's a lot of pressure to turn programmers to soul-less robots with zero integrity and self-esteem who will do anything for money. I quit selling my skills a long time ago to get out of that mess, now I'm spending most of my time empowering others to do the same thing.<p>Cixl is my latest kick in the face to the status quo:

I'm currently using it for my family's budgeting and once I feel it's polished enough I plan to open it up to users.<p>Also working on a closet design app. We bought a house that had completely empty closets (not even a basic closet rod), and learned the hard way that existing closet design solutions are all quite bad. I built a very simple one to meet our needs, then from there kept polishing it. It saved us money as we were able to design a closet that met our exact needs and only buy the needed parts. Most/all closet design apps are "package" oriented, forcing you to commit to less or more than you actually need.

                  Human computation! Not to be too #hailcorporate, but my job's pretty fun. It's using machine learning and humans together to solve problems. The fields pretty focused on labelling tasks, but there's much more to it. Having a large human workforce backed by a bunch of engineers and data scientists is like a fast-forward button on machine learning. You use humans and computers together to do things we really can't automate yet (or even ever, without general AI). ML meets cog-sci meets HCI meets crowdsourcing.

                  I've been building LiveFeeds (<a href="https://www.livefeeds.io/" target="_blank">https://www.livefeeds.io/</a>), a platform for helping online retailers keep their affiliate data feeds and ad networks up to date. Currently, many affiliates work from data feeds that are only published once or twice a day, leaving them out of sync on prices and stock levels for many hours every day.

                  Ok so - I am your target customer exactly. My team is responsible for generating product feed files to give to agencies and engines. The process is extremely painful and usually ends up wasting the time of up to 10 people in the company for what should be some automated process. And here’s the thing - because it’s revenue generating, finding the budget to pay for your service is super duper easy.<p>So with that in mind, here’s some unsolicited feedback -</p><p>* I need you to state your limitations up front. How many products can you handle, what is the size of data you can handle?</p><p>* What platforms do you integrate with? This wasn’t obvious to me after quickly scanning the site</p><p>* Do you let me dedupe, aggregate, or create new data attributes in your platform?

                  Battling mid life crisis this year i suppose, something stirring inside of me lately.  Feeling uneasy..  Been in the data analytics industry within corporate America for 20 years.. Never seen such a bifurcation between the statistical analytics practitioners and the compsci crowd with deep nets.<p>Thinking about the next chapter.  A few buddies and I created an outlet for our math and computation hobby.  Starting to help traders with stat arb.  So we just released a side business site that helps traders who are unfamiliar with all the math - a way to visualize the markets as well as trade pairs or factors in real time.  <a href="https://raveanalytics.com/" target="_blank">https://raveanalytics.com/</a>

It's been growing pretty strongly on its own, and I'm having a great time hacking away at it. I'm building another thing in that space right now, splitting some of my time off from CoinAlerts to work on it; ultimately they'll go together.

                  I'm making an affiliate platform that only charges a commission on the commissions. It lets businesses sign up affiliates (bloggers, news sites, comparison sites, aggregators etc) and pay commissions for sales that affiliates refer. Commissions can be paid with a credit card and don't need a connected bank account or upfront funding (lots of existing affiliate platforms require this and have minimums).<p>The idea is that businesses who don't know yet if affiliate marketing will work can try it without too much upfront investment or commitment. If it does work, then we can help it grow with predictable unit-pricing. And if it does not work, then you didn't need to spend any money or do anything complicated to find that out.</p><p>We'll be looking for beta testers soon. If you might be interested in trying it out, feel free to email me: steve AT referberry.com

Its been going well so far, and I am looking forward to new projects and clients in 2018.<p>I launched ScrumGenius (<a href="https://scrumgenius.com" target="_blank">https://scrumgenius.com</a>). Its a side project I started for fun at my previous job (it was just a simple slack bot script back then) and decided to actually build a service and launch it a few months ago. I did not take it too seriously at first, I was just using it to learn. However, after reading indiehackers and other people launching products I was really inspired to give it a try. Its been steadily growing and it makes around $300/mo.</p><p>Hoping to continue to grow it even more in 2018.</p><p>If anyone is looking for a end to end consultant that does Full Stack Dev with experience in mobile and web! Please do reach out, would love to talk! I am based in Canada and UK.

A minimalist create-your-own adventure RPG/interactive story using nothing but text and emoji. Started as a simple exercise to learn more about front-end development and to build out my portfolio of personal projects. tried to do a kickstarter that was not successful. put together with Django, jQuery, Bootstrap and some JS libraries including underscore and hammer.js and an API for text to speech. For the most part it is spaghetti code and it made me realize that I should really start working on a front end framework, so I’ve been working on ReactJS and will possibly rewrite the game in React.

                  oooooooo. I really really like this webpage :) full of interesting things. The click-to-change background FTW. (Is... are some of the bitmaps from DESQView/X?)<p>Thanks so much for the Apple fonts, I've been meaning to poke the Alto source for ages!!</p><p>Hmm. This idea I've had for a while may interest you, and you may have more success with it than I have: I want to get the fonts off a Psion MC400. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/psionmc400" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/view/psionmc400</a></p><p>(I don't have one.)

I'm not sure how the author of that page obtained their screenshots, but if it's possible to convince the UI to display every possible char from every possible font (telnet, anybody? :D) it seems the process wouldn't be too hard.</p><p>The chances are if I pipe up in a bunch of retrocomputing forums someone will probably turn out to have one or two, but all my assistance would be remote unless there was a unit in Australia (I wouldn't want to risk mailing one here and back).

                  I designed and implemented an in-house timeline system, which collects communications with our customers across all channels (chat, email, sms, phonecalls etc). Learned a lot, but also almost burned out closer to the end of the year. I was working remotely and mostly alone. Scope creep and lack of proper management has bitten me really hard. When I finally launched the app into production, I felt nothing but tiredness.<p>I still can't wrap my head around the React ecosystem. Front-end part was the most time consuming (probably because before this project I did only backend stuff). I enjoy react, but the whole game "build your own build system", "build your own framework" is beyond me. I hope the new year will bring more solutions like nextjs.

Our aim is to manufacture and distribute high quality vape cartridges and pre rolls while contributing to the liberation and well-being of the drug war's many victims and their communities.

                  My little side project is News Uniter [1], and it's an attempt to break out of your news media-consuming bubble and help read different news sources.<p>The most recent update shows the home page of each news site side by side, so you can see what media outlets focus on different headlines. It's interesting to see what is considered "important news" at various places - it can sometimes help better reveal media biases, and, I think, can help people with other political leanings understand those biases more.</p><p>At least one friend could not believe another friend of mine when he claimed that Fox News did not have a particular very important headline at the top of their page. This app could help show, "Here's what each news site thinks is important, and how it may be different from what you think it might be."</p><p>[1] <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/news-uniter/id1182818371?mt=8" target="_blank">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/news-uniter/id1182818371?mt=...</a>

                  I had a busy year. I converted a major auction site to fully responsive as the sole front-end developer and interface designer, learned Java and started doing full stack development at work, and then quit my job when they moved the offices too far away.<p>After quitting I decided to start my own company and began developing next generation assistive devices for the blind. I actually got pretty far along that path when I thought of an idea in a different realm that had much larger potential and required much less development. I can't talk about the specifics yet, but I'm getting very close to launching a new type of mapping service.

                  Not as cool as a lot of these, but I built <a href="https://voyagefound.com" target="_blank">https://voyagefound.com</a> as a react learning project.  It's a filterable interface for viewing random pages on WikiVoyage.org.<p>It's one of those projects that I got 95% done in a few weekends early this year, then lost interest.  I spent some holiday time last week wrapping it up and deploying it.  Actually <i>finishing</i> projects (especially learning projects) is something I often struggle with, so it felt good to get over the finish line on this little project.

                  I have mixed feelings about Arachne. I like the stated purpose, and agree that there's many reasons for a Rails-like framework to exist in Clojure. But Luke seemingly hasn't worked on it in months. It seems like the project is in limbo — it's not finished enough to be usable, and it's not finished enough for other folks with time and willingness to lend a hand. Bummer.

                  If you’re an alcoholic and drink daily, it can be very dangerous to stop cold turkey. If this is more of a lifestyle change, where you drink a few times a week but want to cut it out, I’d say (with zero scientific justification whatsoever) it’s sort of up to the person. Dietary and habitual changes for me have been easiest when made dramatically, but I know for many others that reduces quality outcomes. This is probably one of those scenarios where you need to know which side of the spectrum works best for you from past experiences.

                  I tried to create a new programming language, Toy Santa, but I became too demotivated to finish it. But I feel the codebase of toysanta is the best I've been doing to date.
It's in C++, using Direct2D. One day, I will release it on github. But until then, I will try to create a presentable version.<p>(yes, I am a tad attention-grabbing here;-)</p><p>...I an autodidact, I work for myself.

                  It can't do a lot. The language 'specification' is just a buch of lined paper sheets. What I want my language to do, is a layer between the core of a C++ program, and the user-customizable side.<p>I'm using it to call a zoom function in my skeleton image program.</p><pre><code>  void toysanta() {  
    toy	*nbzoom = nullptr;  
    nbzoom = isVerb(L"setzoomlevel");  
    if(nbzoom) {  
        if(nbzoom-&gt;hasClaus && nbzoom-&gt;sled == toy::integer) {  
            bool	k = false;  
	    POINT	pt = {0,0};  
            toy *xt = getToy(L"x");  
            toy *yt = getToy(L"y");  
            if(xt && yt && xt-&gt;canNumber() && yt-&gt;canNumber()) {  
                pt.x = xt-&gt;getInteger();  
                pt.y = yt-&gt;getInteger();  
                k = true;  
            }  
            setzoomlevel(nbzoom-&gt;claus.integer, k, pt);  
        }  
    }  
  }
</code></pre>
The toysanta() member function is from the VerbCommand class. From the zoom widget, there's<pre><code>  void ZoomWidget::sendzoom_to_target(bool k, POINT pt) {  
    if(target) {  
        std::wstring	cc = L"setzoomlevel ";  
        int		zoom = realZ;//(zPos-32)/3;  
        cc += std::to_wstring(zoom);  
        if(k) {  
            cc += L" x " + std::to_wstring(pt.x);  
            cc += L" y " + std::to_wstring(pt.y);  
        }  
        target-&gt;receive(&cc);  
    }  
  }
</code></pre>
The receive() member function calls the toysanta() function from the target.<p>What I plan, is for it to just be perfect, to be honest. I hope it may help others create better software one day.

                  All of that is my own projects (in random order):<p>1. I made LILGUI[1], an API specification for host programs that use my LIL[2] scripting language to expose simple UI. Also includes LazLILGUI, a Lazarus[3] implementation.</p><p>2. Wrote an OpenGL binding generator [4] for Free Pascal and Lazarus that parses the official XML file. Lazarus comes with OpenGL bindings but they are ancient and i wanted to try out some new 4.6 stuff.</p><p>3. Wrote a simple audio player for X called LFPlayer [5] that uses my Little Forms [6] GUI toolkit and GStreamer as a backend. Note however that some months later i decided to create a new desktop environment and forked off Little Forms to a new (yet unpublished) toolkit that expands a bit the functionality. This is a decision that comes mainly out of frustration with the tech GNOME and KDE use which also covers basically 99% of alternative DEs since they either use GNOME or KDE/Qt tech. But that is something that i'll hopefully expand on next year (or in 2019... or whenever i get around working on it, it isn't a big priority anyway :-P).</p><p>4. I started a VB1 clone in Windows 3.1 for fun [7] although it has very dim chances of being finished. I also did a blunder with this by first starting it in DOSBox, then due to some DOSBox shortcomings i moved it to VirtualBox, left it untouched for like a month and then coming back to it - but i had forgotten that i moved to VirtualBox and continued working on it in DOSBox pretty much redoing most of the work until at some point i encountered a bug and as i solved it i thought "wait a minute, didn't i already fixed this bug?". On the bright side the new solution was better.</p><p>5. Wrote a reusable unit in Free Pascal for winged edge mesh edit operations [8]. If you have used Wings3D, you know what i am talking about. I'll use this at some in the future in my generic 3D world editor either in addition or as a replacement for brushes for world geometry [9]</p><p>6. Wrote a reusable control for 3D viewports in Lazarus [10]. Each one of those viewports is a separate instance of the control with a shared viewport renderer, viewport manager, 3D widget manager and transformation 3D widget.</p><p>7. Wrote a very simple scenegraph library in C for fun, inspired (from a functional standpoint) by the old Direct3D retained mode API and made a Python module with it using SWIG [11]. At some point i should upload this somewhere, it is neat.</p><p>8. I'm still spending most of my time working on my 3D retro top down-ish shooter [12]. No i don't use that monitor all the time, only when i need to feel that extra oldschool power (and when playing some old 2D games that simply display better on a CRT :-P).</p><p>I probably forgot some stuff, i mainly looked through my repositories [13] and images in imgur to see what i did. I think i haven't done much this year, but hopefully in 2018 i'll get around making the first versioned stable release for LIL (which will mark the day the API will remain backwards compatible for the future) and release LIL Studio [14], a simple IDE for LIL that allows remote editing of scripts (mainly useful for editing the game scripts remotely [15]) and perhaps release a preview of my desktop environment, although most of the stuff i focus on revolve around my game so the DE (and other unrelated stuff) only takes a back seat most of the time (i tend to work on it whenever i see something in /r/linux or news about current DEs that make my blood boil or something :-P). But since i use Little Forms for the launcher of the game, i'll need to have at least the forked version working since unlike Little Forms, the fork supports custom styles and i'd like to have that.</p><p>[1] <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/rep/lilgui" target="_blank">http://runtimeterror.com/rep/lilgui</a>
