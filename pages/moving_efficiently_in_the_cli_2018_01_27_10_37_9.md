<p>I found a useful table with most of those in the <strong><a href="https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks2" target="_blank">How Linux Works</a></strong> book that I'm currently reading, and some more on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>If you plan on using them, please bear in mind that these keyboard shorcuts depend on quite a number of things: the Unix distribution that you're using, your shell, your own configuration quirks... so YMMV.</p>
