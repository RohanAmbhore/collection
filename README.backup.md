 > When building React applications (or any application actually), we need it to look great. For web applications, the standard beautification language is called CSS. Since the age of the dinosaurs, properly structuring CSS styles and arranging them has always been a problem. In small apps this is not really a problem, but with applications of larger structure things are bound to get real hazy. With CSS Modules we can modularize things in React and add some structure to the flow. In this article we...

 > 一劳永逸的搞定 flex 布局 寻根溯源话布局 一切都始于这样一个问题：怎样通过 CSS 简单而优雅的实现水平、垂直同时居中。记得刚开始学习 CSS 的时候，看到 float 属性不由得感觉眼前一亮，顺理成章的联想到 Word 文档排版中用到的的左对齐、右对齐和居中对齐，然而很快就失望的发现 CSS 中并不存在 float: center 的写法，那么 text-align: center、verticle-align: center 是否可行呢？答案也是否定的。这两个属性只能用于行内元素，对于块级元素的布局是无效的。 在网页布局没有进入 CSS 的时代，排版几乎是通过 table 元素实现的，在 table 的单元格里可以方便的使用 align、valign 来实现水平和垂直方向的对齐，随着 Web 语义化的流行，这些写法逐渐淡出了视野，CSS 标准为我们提供了 3 种布局方式：标准文档流、浮动布局和定位布局。这几种方式的搭配使用可以轻松搞定 PC 端页面的常见需求，比如实现水平居中可以使用 margin: 0 auto，实现水平垂直同时居中可以如下设置： .dad { positi...

 > Short Answer Although the flex-wrap property seems pretty basic – it controls whether flex items can wrap – it actually has a wide-ranging impact on the entire flexbox layout. The flex-wrap property determines the type of flex container you will use. flex-wrap: nowrap creates a single-line flex container flex-wrap: wrap and wrap-reverse create a multi-line flex container The align-items and align-self properties work in both single- and multi-line containers.

It’s also a feature that’s been hidden in the React documentation in the past and, although it is now documented on the React site I thought a post on its usage and when to use it would be of use. The short answer is that you should very rarely, if ever use context in your own React components. However, if you’re writing a library of components, it can come in useful, and we’ll discuss why this is later. ...

 > vue常见面试题 1:什么是mvvm？ MVVM是Model-View-ViewModel的缩写。mvvm是一种设计思想。Model 层代表数据模型，也可以在Model中定义数据修改和操作的业务逻辑；View 代表UI 组件，它负责将数据模型转化成UI 展现出来，ViewModel 是一个同步View 和 Model的对象。 在MVVM架构下，View 和 Model 之间并没有直接的联系，而是通过ViewModel进行交互，Model 和 ViewModel 之间的交互是双向的， 因此View 数据的变化会同步到Model中，而Model 数据的变化也会立即反应到View 上。 ViewModel 通过双向数据绑定把 View 层和 Model 层连接了起来，而View 和 Model 之间的同步工作完全是自动的，无需人为干涉，因此开发者只需关注业务逻辑，不需要手动操作DOM, 不需要关注数据状态的同步问题，复杂的数据状态维护完全由 MVVM 来统一管理。 2:mvvm和mvc区别？ mvc和mvvm其实区别并不大。都是一种设计思想。主要就是mvc中Controller演变成mvvm...

 > 5 个回答默认排序​ 郑航距離をおいてこそ、自分の大きさを知る19 人赞同了该回答 早期的Web前端开发者中流传着这些描述了CSS编写方式的名词：固定布局：顾名思义，网页上的所有元素的尺寸一律使用px作为单位。这种布局方式对设计师和CSS编写者来说都是最简单的，亦没有兼容性问题，例如，直接设定网页的主体部分宽度为960px，某个搜索框宽度为60px等等。缺点显而易见，即不能根据用户的屏幕尺寸做出不同的表现。当前，大部分门户网站、大部分企业的PC宣传站点都采用了这种布局方式。在移动端开发中其实也可以采用固定布局，以下列出两种方式：在viewport meta标签上设置width=320，页面的各个元素也采用px作为单位。通过用JS动态修改标签的initial-scale使得页面等比缩放，从而刚好占满整个屏幕。（见前端开发-web app 变革之rem）设在viewport meta标签上设置content"width=640,user-scalable=no，页面的各个元素也采用px作为单位。由于640px超出了手机宽度，浏览器会自动缩小页面至刚好全屏。（具体见content"width...
