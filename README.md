 > Building a Deep Learning Camera with a Raspberry Pi and YOLO Amazon has just announced DeepLens, a smart webcam that uses machine learning to detect objects, faces, and activities like playing a guitar on the camera itself. The DeepLens isn’t available yet, but the idea of a smart camera is exciting. Imagine being able to use a camera that’s able to tell when you’re playing a guitar, or creating a new dance, or just learning new skateboard tricks. It could use the raw image data to tell if you l...

We all have favorite papers in our own respective areas of theory. Every once in a while, one finds a paper so astounding (e.g., important, compelling, deceptively simple, etc.) that one wants to share it with everyone. So list these papers here! They don't have to be from theoretica...

 > Turing's proof From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Turing's proof is a proof by Alan Turing, first published in January 1937 with the title "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem." It was the second proof of the assertion (Alonzo Church's proof was first) that some decision problems are "undecidable": there is no single algorithm that infallibly gives a correct "yes" or "no" answer to each instance of the problem. In his own words: "...
