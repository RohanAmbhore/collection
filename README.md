 > 2017 年 12 月 28 日 致广大用户关于 iPhone 电池及性能的说明 最近，对我们在使用较早期电池 iPhone 性能表现上的处理方式，以及对这一处理方式的沟通说明，我们一直都在听取用户的意见和反馈。有些用户因此对 Apple 感到失望，在这里，我们致以诚挚的歉意。关于这个问题存在着许多的误解，所以我们想向大家澄清其中原委，并向大家说明我们正在做出的一些改变。 首先也是最重要的一点，我们从来没有、也永远不会通过任何手段，来有意缩短任何 Apple 产品的使用寿命，更不会降低用户体验来迫使大家升级设备。一直以来，我们的目标都是创造备受用户喜爱的产品，而尽可能延长 iPhone 的使用寿命，正是其中的重要一环。 电池的使用寿命 所有充电电池都属于易耗部件，其使用性能会随着化学老化而降低，蓄电能力也会逐渐衰退。而电池充电的时间和次数，并不是影响其化学老化的唯一因素。 会影响到电池使用寿命的，还有设备的使用方式。例如，将设备放在高温环境下，或在高温环境下充电，电池就会老化得更快。这些都是电池本身的化学特性，也是整个行业内锂离子电池的共性。 化学年龄较老的电池应对峰值负载的能力也在衰...
